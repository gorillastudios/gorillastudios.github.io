        This past weekend I was able to get out and somewhat enjoy the most recent total lunar eclipse. Despite my better judgement knowing that it was going to be in the single digits I packed up my gear and headed...

        Back in June I was able to photograph the ISS transiting the moon for the first time, and while I was generally happy with it, I knew I could do better. So ever since I have been keeping an eye...

    <p>My primary astrophotography rig consists of a Celestron Ultima 11" Schmidt Cassegrain OTA which was actually built in 1994 or so, but it's still an amazing telescope. The 11" mirror gives it a focal length of 2800mm at f/11. With a focal reducer mounted on the back it drops to 1680mm but speeds up to f/6.3 which is much faster. I mounted the OTA on a new Celestron CGEM GoTo computerized mount so I can track deep sky objects for long exposures. It's quite a steep learning curve, but this hobby is a marathon, not a sprint. I purchased a StarSense to make polar alignment even more precise. The StarSense is not a guide camera, I don't want to be saddled with a laptop when I'm out in the field.</p>

    For as long as I can remember I've always been fascinated by everything to do with space. Recently, I tore through Mike Massimino's book Spaceman and now am reading The Interstellar Age, which is about NASA's Voyager 1 &amp; 2...

    The North American Solar Eclipse has been on my calendar for about two years, so now that it's past I am incredibly relieved everything went smoothly. The long build up allowed me to be as ready as I could be,...

    <p class="post__listing--preview">
    My Celestron Ultima 11" Schmidt Cassegrain telescope was originally built in 1995, and while the optical tube was in great shape, the original fork mount was getting pretty out-dated. It was difficult to assemble and almost unmanageable by one person...

    After impatiently waiting a month for clear skies I finally got my 'new' Celestron Ultima 11" Schmidt Cassegrain out for a test run. I couldn't get tack sharp focus so I knew a collimation was in order and looking closely...
