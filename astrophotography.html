        This past weekend I was able to get out and somewhat enjoy the most recent total lunar eclipse. Despite my better judgement knowing that it was going to be in the single digits I packed up my gear and headed...

        Back in June I was able to photograph the ISS transiting the moon for the first time, and while I was generally happy with it, I knew I could do better. So ever since I have been keeping an eye...

    <p>My primary astrophotography rig consists of a Celestron Ultima 11" Schmidt Cassegrain OTA which was actually built in 1994 or so, but it's still an amazing telescope. The 11" mirror gives it a focal length of 2800mm at f/11. With a focal reducer mounted on the back it drops to 1680mm but speeds up to f/6.3 which is much faster. I mounted the OTA on a new Celestron CGEM GoTo computerized mount so I can track deep sky objects for long exposures. It's quite a steep learning curve, but this hobby is a marathon, not a sprint. I purchased a StarSense to make polar alignment even more precise. The StarSense is not a guide camera, I don't want to be saddled with a laptop when I'm out in the field.</p>
