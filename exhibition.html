<div class="c-exhibition__intro">
  <p>A selection of my work will be on display at the Batavia Fine Arts Centre from February to mid March. Chicago's oldest continuously operated off-loop theatre, the Athenaeum Theatre is a beautiful building located in the Lakeview neighborhood on the north side. An Sunday afternoon reception is being for mid-February, and I will make an announcement when the details are settled.</p>
  <p>Framed prints are available for sale, and unframed matted prints will be available at the reception.</p>
  <p>The prints are currently hanging in the gallery on the main floor behind the box office. From the main doors head up the stairs and the box office is to your right. The entrance to the gallery is just around the corner, but before the main doors to the theatre floor.</p>
