<p>In February I accepted a design residency at <a href="http://www.8thlight.com">8th Light</a> in Chicago, so needless to say that has been my primary focus lately.  One of my residency requirements is to write weekly blog posts about my experience and what I am learning. I wrote an entirely new <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> powered blog hosted on github to share my experiences. You can check it out at <a href="http://cpeak.github.com">cpeak.github.com</a>. It also has a lot of design &amp; development resources. Enjoy!</p>
