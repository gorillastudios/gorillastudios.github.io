<p>My favorite photo from November was taken from the 80th floor of the Aeon Center in downtown Chicago. I am lucky enough to shoot my company's yearly software craftsmanship conference and this year provided some spectacular sunsets. I was wrapping up at the end of the first day and packing my gear when I saw a few people going to the west side of the building and pulling out their phones. I hurriedly got my tripod out and was able to snap some longer exposures right as the sun was dipping below the horizon. The photo was an 8 second exposure at f/16.</p>

<p>The picture looks fantastic and I got a lot of positive feedback on it from various places, but I am still disappointed that the window was rather dirty. At larger sizes you can see streaking and image distortion around the Sears Tower which I hope I can lessen or remove in Photoshop, but that will be a lot of work.</p>
<p>I can't believe I only have a month left for the Photo365 challenge. I've kept with it the best I can, but its been getting difficult to post every day. I still have my camera on me, but as it gets colder its getting much more difficult to get out over lunch or take a longer walk after work to get some good images. I just have to brave the cold for another few weeks and I will have hit my goal! Time to keep shooting.</p>
