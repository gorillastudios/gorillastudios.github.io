<p>My Photo of the Month from September was a macro shot I snapped one morning on the way to the train station. I have been so busy with work and other things on my plate its been very difficult to keep up, but I have stuck with the 365 challenge so far. Even though I have been running around like mad, I love this shot I grabbed in only a minute or two during my commute. The leaves in late September are just starting to turn in the Chicagoland area and this particular one caught my eye as it laid on the ground. I love the brilliance of the color combined with the texture, I had to fill the entire frame with it, which was not particularly hard because this leaf was about the size of my hand!</p>

<p>Now that its early October the leaves are really starting to turn, its a fantastic month for landscape photography, so grab your gear and get outside!</p>
