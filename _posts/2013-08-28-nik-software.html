<p>I have spent the past two weeks playing around with <a href="http://www.niksoftware.com/nikcollection/usa/intro.html">The Nik Collection</a> by Google, which is comprised of Silver Efex Pro 2, Dfine 2, Viveza 2, HDR Efex Pro 2, Color Efex Pro 4, and Sharpener Pro 3. They are a set of tools to provide you with a wider array of options when it comes to color correction, black and white conversion, noise reduction and more.  The main reason for downloading the free trial was to play around with Silver Efex which comes highly recommended from a few pro photographers I follow. I wasn't expecting miracles from the software, but I was hoping to be impressed enough to purchase the package and integrate it into my workflow, which I am always looking to improve.</p>
<p>Downloading was a breeze and installation was as simple as any application on the Mac, so there were no issues there. When you open up an image in Photoshop you get a fairly jarring popup window with links to launch each of the programs in the package. I would have liked to see Google integrate the visuals better for Photoshop somehow, but I may just be nitpicking.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I took a photo at sundown of the Chicago skyline from just north of the city right on Lake Michigan. The original had a wonderful mix of purples and oranges, combined with the white and yellow lights from the city itself. I thought this would be the perfect candidate for a black &amp; white conversion, so it became my first test subject. I pulled it up in Photoshop and launched Silver Efex.</p>
<h3>Silver Efex Pro 2</h3>

<p>I was initially surprised by the number of pre-set filter options but as I quickly surfed through them my level of excitement diminished. I would say a good half of them were unusable with the default settings, but the other half presented some interesting options. I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to editing so I shy away from super highly edited or stylized photos (which is also why I am starting to lose faith in the HDR-fest known as 500px.com). Im sure the filters I immediately dismissed could be adjusted to provide useable results since there is a large number of settings available. Also my sample size of trying three photos is woefully inadequate to establish a good sense of how the program can perform under different circumstances. On the bright-side I am very happy with how fine-grained the settings can get giving pixel-obsessed photographers a fresh new playground they can run wild in.</p>

<p>Here is part of the options window for Silver Efex. The number of settings is truly impressive. You can adjust brightness by highlights, mid-tones, and shadows, there are multiple contrast options, structure, tonality, color filters, grain, sensitivity, the list goes on and on. I think I could spend a month or two learning just Silver Efex and not know everything available to me. A cursory search online and I found multiple resources for tutorials and guides to help you get the most out of the software, so documentation and help are certainly not lacking.</p>
<h3>Color Efex Pro 4</h3>

<p>Color Efex Pro 4 was extremely similar to Silver Efex so I am not going to try not to repeat myself. Some great options right out of the box, but some looked over the top and silly (my opinion of a lot of Instagram photos as well). Again, the options are fantastic and you can tweak a photo to your hearts desire. Before I took the photo I used with Silver Efex, I snapped this one of a man just enjoying the late afternoon on Lake Michigan. The original photo itself was a bit lack luster. I loved the composition, but the colors were washed out and it just felt dull compared to how wonderful it looked from behind the lens. Color Efex let me bring out the sky and lake a little more and gave the image a little more punch. It's not an award winner by any means, but I am pleased that I was able to use the software to enhance an otherwise throw-away photo and make it something at the very least I can enjoy.</p>
<p>The options for Color Efex are just as robust as Silver Efex. They do change depending on which filter you have selected, but again the options are extremely fine-grained giving you almost limitless flexibility for color-balancing and color-adjustments.</p>
<h3>Sharpener Pro and Dfine 2</h3>
<p>I haven't had the chance to play around with either of these yet, but I am looking forward to running them through their paces before my trial runs out. Sharpener Pro claims to 'bring out hidden details consistently', while Dfine is a noise reduction program 'tailored to your camera'. I am naturally skeptical but very open-minded, so I will share my thoughts when I take a deeper dive into the other half of the collection.</p>
<h3>Initial Impression</h3>
<p>Overall I am very pleased with the Nik Collection so far, and when I have a bit more spending cash will plop down the $149 to purchase the entire suite. Google seems to have hit a sweet spot where out of the box you can get some great results without much fiddling, yet the rabbit hole is there so more advanced users can dive down and explore as much as they want. I wish I had more than 15 days for the demo, but even just using it for two weeks I feel that $149 is a good price for what you get. When I make the purchase and learn more I will be sharing more thoughts, so be sure to stay tuned.</p>
