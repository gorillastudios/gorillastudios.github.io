<p>Today on my walk to the train station after work I took a quick detour and randomly stopped into the James Thompson government center on Randolph and Clark in the Loop. It's the kind of place you could walk by a thousand times and not notice anything about it. I first went in years ago because there is a DMV in the basement, and thats when I realized the interior of the building is this beautiful half open all space up to the ceiling, a sprawling web of glass and steel. The elevator stacks are exposed in the center, with offices wrapping around in a circle on the outside, and a large hole in the floor looking down to the basement level.</p>
<p>I walked in and poked around a little bit, but you are restricted because it is a government building, and they can be a bit picky about photographers. I walked up to the first floor above the lobby and took a 5 shot panorama from floor to ceiling.</p>

<p>I love the blue glass near the entrance, and all the exposed staircases, so many little details that almost get lost in the photo. If you are downtown I recommend you at least stop in and look around for a few minutes.</p>
