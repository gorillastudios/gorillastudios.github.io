intro: 'Catching a lunar ISS transit'

<p>I've always been fascinated by all things space. I recently tore through Mike Massamino's book <i>Spaceman</i> and now I am currently reading <i>The Intersteller Age</i>, which is about NASA's Voyager 1 &amp; 2 missions. My daughter delights in watching Commander Chris Hadfield's videos from the International Space Station so much that we've seen every one many many times. Since I am a certified Space Geek, it's only natural that I try to combine that with my passion for photography.</p>

<p>I've seen lots of photos of the International Space Station transiting both the sun and the moon, but how on earth did they do that? Could I do that? The station itself is orbiting the earth at 17,500mph, which makes photographing it like chasing a bullet. The first step was to find a tool to tell me where and when it would be. After some searching I stumbled across <a href="http://www.transit-finder.com" target="blank">Transit Finder</a> which given a lat/long and date range would give tell me exactly where and when I needed to be down to the millisecond.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly options are limited if you don't want to travel a few hours to make an attempt. I checked the site weekly for at least a year. Most seemingly great opportunities slipping by due to scheduling conflicts or just poor weather. I finally made my first attempt a month ago on May 1st at 6am. I rolled out of bed at 4:30 and drove 45 minutes south to see if I could capture the ISS just after sunrise. Once everything was setup I used an iPhone app called SkyView Lite to track the progress of both the station and the Moon, and everything looked perfect. I was ready.</p>

<p>I checked my phone a few more times, and when I got about two minutes out I just sat there, staring through the camera's eye piece watching as hard as I could. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Nothing. Checked the app again and the ISS had blown right past, I have no idea if it was close, I never even spotted it. I was dissapointed, but determined to figure it out. When I got home I realized that the ISS was illuminated and appeared as a white spot reflecting sunlight, and I was looking for the distinct black silhouette making the crossing. Okay, rookie mistake. I made a note and went back to checking Transit Finder every few days.</p>

<p>Finally two weeks ago I saw a transit happening just after the full moon, 6 minutes after midnight on a Thursday night. Looking closer I could get on the center line only travelling about 20 minutes from home, and thats including three backup sites incase of who knows what. I picked a farm road off the beaten path where I could setup and not be hassled by anyone. I had the time, I had the place, now the only x-factor was the weather.</p>
