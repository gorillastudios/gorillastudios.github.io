<p>I've always wanted an original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolleiflex">Rolliflex Twin Lens Reflex camera</a> but could never pull the trigger due to the cost
of one in good condition. I was poking around Amazon a few weeks ago and found some replica kits for only $25, so I
added it to my wish-list. Lo and behold one arrived at my door a few days after my birthday! The kit comes completely
disassembled, with a screwdriver and a single roll of 35mm ISO200 film.</p>

<p>Opening it up I was rather surprised <i>how much</i> assembly was required. Everything down to the shutter was
in pieces, and unfortunately the instructions were obviously translated into English, meaning they were about as
clear as mud. Thankfully I know my way around a film camera so everything was fairly easy to figure out, the biggest
problem was that two of the shutter springs were mis-labelled. Once I figured that out assembly wasn't too bad.</p>
<p>The quality is exactly what you would expect from a $25 dollar kit. Everything is plastic and on the flimsier side,
but as completed kit it holds up okay. I will load it up with film and pick something to shoot in the next few days.
Stay tuned for the results.</p>
