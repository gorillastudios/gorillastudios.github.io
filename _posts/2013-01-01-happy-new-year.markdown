<p>Happy New Year from Gorilla-Studios!</p>
<p>Since its January 1st and everyone under the sun is making resolutions, I've decided to jump on the bandwagon. This year I am going to try to complete a Photo 365 Challenge (tip o' the hat to <a href="http://www.kandirich.com">Kandi Rich</a> for the inspiration).  If you want a project to push you all year be sure to checkout <a href="http://content.photojojo.com/tips/7-new-year-projects/#more-32021">Photojojo's 7 New Year Projects</a> for some great inspiration if you're not quite up to a 365 day photo challenge. My other resolution is to post more often and keep working on the site. Last year was spent focusing on getting married and my new full-time job, so this year I am going to set aside time to grow my site and skills the best I can.</p>
<p>Heres to 2013!</p>
