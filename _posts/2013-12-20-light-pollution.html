<p>Do you live in a urban area or close to a city and have too much light pollution for good night photography? I love long exposures of star trails and night skies, but since I live near Chicago it's next to impossible to view stars let alone take any photos. Previously I would look at Google Maps to plot where I might drive to by looking for sparse areas, but even then its a guess as to how much light pollution there is in the area.</p>
<p>Luckily I found a tool called <a href="http://www.blue-marble.de/nightlights/2012">Blue Marble</a> which overlays nighttime satellite images onto Google Maps allowing you to plot where the best spots for stargazing would be.</p>

<p>As you can see above, Chicago and its surrounding counties are completely worthless. To find a suitable spot I have to drive at least a few hours, and for spectacular night skies I think Nebraska is the closest location. Check out where you live and find the best spot near you to haul out your photo gear and or telescope.</p>
