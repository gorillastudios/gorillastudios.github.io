<p>A sudden downpour came in during the parade of sails in Chicago, but that didn't ruin our day. More photos to come.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was contacted by the Captain of this beautiful ship and learned she is the Privateer Lynx from New Hampshire. Upon further investigation the ship on her port side is the Madeline, and the ship dissapearing behind the lighthouse is the Friends Good Will.</p>
