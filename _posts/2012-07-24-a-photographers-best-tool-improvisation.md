<p>One lesson I have learned in my years of shooting is that you should always be ready to improvise. It's a good idea to plan your shoots to get a good idea of what you want to accomplish but you always have to be ready to throw it out the window and get what you can.</p>

<p>I went out after work last Friday and decided to go down to Navy Pier and take some dusk shots of the Ferris Wheel and spinning swings. I wanted to catch them as the sun was going down and use a slower shutter speed to capture some motion. After taking a few test shots I was approached by a security guard and he told me firmly that they did not allow tripods during high traffic periods 'due to safety concerns'. I was frustrated and voiced my displeasure since I was actually using it as a monopod, but rather than having a chat with the Chicago Police I decided to move along. Needless to say I was in a bad mood, but instead of just packing up and heading home I started walking up the lakefront. I knew there was a great park just north of Navy Pier with a beautiful view of the skyline and lots of boat activity, so I decided to try to see what I could get up there. Again I setup and started composing my shots, taking some test exposures and watching the sun sink farther and farther. Just as I started to feel good about everything a Chicago Police officer reported that the park was closing and ran everyone out. This was yet another opportunity to throw my hands up and pack it in. Thankfully I stayed cool and left the park and went down to the beach around the corner. After double-checking with the officer I found that it was open until 10 so I wouldn't have any problems. As the golden hour set in I started getting some great shots and all my frustrations just drifted away.</p>

<p>This was the last shot before the sun finally went down, taken at 19mm <i>f</i>/8 for 30 seconds. I would have missed this opportunity had I gotten angry and just headed home.</p>

<p>Here is another great example. This photo was taken when I went out last summer looking for more Great Blue Herons that were nested near my house. I was walking along the Fox River looking at the tree line when the color of these flowers really caught my eye. I switched over to my 50mm macro lens and started photographing these bold flowers. I was just about to pack up when I noticed this bug on one flower, climbing the stamen. I would have totally missed this had I not had my eyes open.</p>



<p>Always be sure to have an idea of what you want to get before you even leave the house but keep your eyes and mind open to something completely different. Looking through my portfolio there are quite a few shots that were a complete surprise to me at the time. Whether its a scenery or lighting change, location change, equipment malfunction or whatever, one of the best tools you can have is being able to stay calm and get the shot that presents itself to you.</p>
