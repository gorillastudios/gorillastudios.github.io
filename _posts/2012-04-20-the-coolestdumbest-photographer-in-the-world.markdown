<p>Found this on <a href="http://memebase.com/2012/04/20/internet-memes-just-escaped-death-still-taking-pictures/">Memebase</a>.  This guy is both 1) Incredibly calm given the circumstances, and 2) Incredibly stupid for being that close to the action.  I think 99% of the time that would have ended the other way. Had a car almost clipped me I don't think I would calmly take pictures as it went by, id be changing my pants.</p>

<p>Don't try this at home kids.</p>
