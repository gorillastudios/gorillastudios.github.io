intro: 'Upgrading my Manfrotto with a new Arca-Swiss mount'

<p>During my recent trip to Portland the quick release plate on my Manfrotto ballhead malfunctioned - the pin that holds the release lever open and ready for the camera to mount seized shut, meaning the latch doesn't stay open. Im pretty sure the combination of salty air and a small amount of sea water are the culprit. After a few days of hitting it with WD-40 then PB Blaster I had no luck getting the pin to move again.</p>

<p>I figured I could use this as an excuse to finally get myself a new Arca-Swiss compatible head and L-bracket, but I wasn't too excited about replacing the head itself since it was still in excellent condition. After a little bit of searching I found I could simply replace the plate with an adapter, so I settled on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Haoge-CP-58-Arca-Swiss-Compatible-Manfrotto-Replacement/dp/B01CAO7PR4?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_act_title_1&smid=AST9DIMYBFQ3A">Haoge Combo Boss Adapter</a>. While it doesn't have the quick release clamp like the Manfrotto, I find that during shooting I don't take the camera off tripod enough to make me miss that feature.</p>

<p>I shoot a lot of panoramas, so I have been itching to get an L bracket letting me mount the camera both horizontally or vertically instead of turning the camera 90&deg; on the ballhead, losing a good 6" of height (im 6'6", so every inch counts).</p>
