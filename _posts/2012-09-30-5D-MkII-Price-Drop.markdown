<p><a href="http://www.canonrumors.com/2012/09/big-canon-eos-5d-mark-ii-price-drop-coming/">Canon Rumors</a> reports that there is a big price drop coming on the Canon EOS 5D MkII. This is a great deal for someone looking into upgrade to a more capable body but cannot justify spending $3500 on the MkIII.  Just remember - the MkII is still a great camera, and a terrific bargain now.</p>
<p><strong> UPDATE </strong> - <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/583953-REG/Canon_2764B003_EOS_5D_Mark_II.html">B&amp;H Photo</a> has the body only on sale for $1799. This really makes me think long and hard about my next major purchase.</p>
