<p>A few weeks ago I went out and did a star-trail test run where I learned quite a bit about the process and after all was said and done was ready to go out and do it for real on a clear night without the full moon. Of course my excitement was dampened quite a bit when I saw nothing but rain and clouds on the ten day weather report.</p>

<p>As you can see the clouds came and covered the entire sky, the flickering on the ground is from when they sporadically covered the moon. I learned a lot and will be much more confident when I go out during the next new moon to capture something really special. Stay tuned and happy star-gazing!</p>
