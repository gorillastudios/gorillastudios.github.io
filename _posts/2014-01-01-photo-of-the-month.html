<p>My final Photo of the Month was a shot that inspired a small collection of photos that I will post soon. I was riding the Metra and decided to keep my camera out to see if I could find anything creative that was right under my nose every morning. I take the Union Pacific West line which heads directly east into the city and early in the morning the sun is particularly low in the sky allowing for some really creative shots. I snapped this one as the sun was directly behind a crossing signal, creating a really striking silhouette.</p>

<p>I typically hate shooting through the Metra windows because they are scratched, dirty, and usually tinted some really awful 1970s orange or green. Although I found having the sun right behind my subject exaggerated the green tint creating an extremely saturated background to the completely solid black foreground.</p>
<p>On the same trip in I got a shot of the sun passing behind the Sears Tower, along with a handful of other photos, but none quite as striking as this one. I made three more attempts of the Sears shot (as well as one attempt with my iPhone for a fun comparison), which I will post along with the others soon.</p>
