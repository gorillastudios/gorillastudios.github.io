<p><a href="http://www.theoatmeal.com">The Oatmeal</a> is possibly one of the most creative laugh-out-loud funny (and <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/semicolon">educational</a>) web-comics I have come across in recent years and it breaks my heart to see Matthew Inman getting ripped off by FunnyJunk.  Arstechnica has <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/06/funnyjunk-vs-the-oatmeal.ars">a great article</a> about FunnyJunk lifting Inman's work with little to no attribution.  Be sure to read Matthew's thoughtful and insightful <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/blog/funnyjunk2">response</a> to the whole ordeal.  As a footnote - if you want to see the downfall of human culture in action just look at any internet forum or youtube comment thread.</p>

<p>As an artist I am extremely nervous about my own work being ripped off, but thankfully (or not) I am not well-known enough to have that happen.  I have struggled with how to handle copyrighting and watermarking my images to protect my work, however I don't want to treat my tens of readers/viewers like criminals.</p>
