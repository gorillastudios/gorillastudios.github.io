<p>Another chilly evening in Chicago, but this time I went down to Millenium Park. While there are ropes around Pritzker Pavilion I didn't feel too bad stepping over since there were already tracks through the snow and the security guard by the Bean seemed pretty engrossed in his smartphone. I jogged out to the center of the field and snapped a few shots trying to frame the bandshell, Aon Tower and the overhead beams as carefully as I could. I love the colors and how sharp this photo turned out. Worth getting a boot-full of snow.</p>
