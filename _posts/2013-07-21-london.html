<p>Back in May I was lucky enough to fly out to London to attend the Future of Web Design conference and while I was there I had some free time to explore with my camera. I flew out of Chicago on Friday afternoon, arriving very early on Saturday morning. I was delighted to find that after an eight hour flight it was a breeze figuring out my way into the city. I dropped my luggage off at the hotel because I couldn't check in until later, took my camera gear and headed out. Finding your way around is pretty tricky because roads in London change names every few blocks, thankfully I am pretty good at directions and figured out my way with only a few hiccups. An unplanned nap at Starbucks recharged my batteries (many thanks to the staff for letting me rest!), and I found my way down to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. I scouted out both sides of the river and just soaked in the scenery for at least an hour or two waiting for the sun to start going down before taking photos.</p>

<p>There are two beautiful parks on either side of the river, so I was torn on which to shoot from. This first shot was a 30 second exposure at f/16 with an ND filter, taken on the north side of the Thames with the Tower of London just behind my back. I was hoping to get more lights and have the river a bit more glassy, but the weather was getting pretty poor and a few shots after this it started dumping rain and blowing wind pretty hard. My umbrella lasted a few minutes so I scrambled to pack my gear and seek shelter.</p>

<p>After watching it rain for ten minutes under the base of the bridge a Policeman shooed us away since the park was closing so I ran for the nearest tube station. I was completely soaked but my gear was in good shape - my Kata bag came with a rain cover which kept everything nice and dry. I wish I could say the same about me. Once the storm front rolled through I made my way up Bishopsgate Road towards my hotel. I snapped another long exposure just to capture the vibrancy and color of the city after the rain.</p>

<p>While walking back to the hotel I stumbled across Leadenhall Market which is a beautiful open-air market filled with small shops specializing in wine, cheese, chocolate and more. I stopped a few more times over the weekend but unfortunately it was closed every time. I took some shots Saturday night before retiring back to the hotel but this particular photo was taken the next morning. It was a bit difficult balancing the sunlight from the skylights and the lamps overhead, but a half-second exposure at f/6.3, ISO 200 seemed to do the trick. I loved the feel of the shops with all the flags overhead and the cobblestone walkway and the skylights overhead, I just wish I could have seen it full of people.</p>

<p>Sunday morning after stopping at Leadenhall Market I made my way by tube down to Westminster and Buckingham Palace. I was surprised at how densely packed the tourists were clustered around each of the landmarks. Being from Chicago and always being slightly annoyed by them I tried my best to stay away from the crowds. I wanted photos that were distinctly my own, and not the typical tourist shots I have seen a million times before. The morning was gloomy to say the least, but thats not always bad when it comes to photography. I circled Westminster Abbey once looking at the beautiful architecture before deciding where to shoot from. There was a small park adjacent to the main bell towers that everyone seemed to be ignoring. Making my way over I took this photo, which I didn't have a lot of hope fore since it was so flat in color. It wasn't until I converted it to black and white that the contrast made it really pop.</p>

<p>I could probably spend a week just shooting the Abbey itself but I only had 2 days to cover as much of the city as I could. Before leaving I wanted to get at least some of the stunning details of Westminster itself. Here is a shot from the back of the Abbey, the entire building is covered in ornate decoration, this was above one of the back entrances. The main statue is probably four feet tall, the rows of figures above it maybe ten inches each. I can only imagine how long it took to craft just this entrance alone, let alone the entire building.</p>

<p>After the Abbey I walked over to Buckingham Palace which was a tourist nightmare. I snapped a few photos but was disappointed that the palace guards were probably 50 yards behind the wrought iron gates so we couldn't get close. I had read that you could get close and personal with them at the Palace of St. James but I couldn't find them. A walk around Hyde Park and back around I heard marching music and a lot of commotion headed my way. I headed in the direction of the music and was pleasantly surprised to come across a small parade. A large contingent of Palace Guards in their bearskin helmets came marching by followed closely by a large number of thoroughly british gentlemen in bowler hats, three-piece suits, and black umbrellas. If I had seen it on TV my first thought is that it was some Monty Python sketch, but sure enough, there they were. Im still not sure what the parade was about and for some reason it didn't occur to me to ask anyone. I liked this exposure because while playing around with the settings as they walked by, I slowed the shutter down just a hair to capture some motion blur. The guards arms are starting to blur and there is a hair of movement on his medals, but his head was steady. What a fun sight it was.</p>

<p>Monday was spent at the conference, but afterwards I made my way back to Westminster. My goal that night was to shoot the London Eye and Elizabeth Tower - most people incorrectly call 'Big Ben', which is the name of the bell inside the tower itself. Like I said before I try not to take typical tourst photos, but I did want to catch a double decker bus at some point. Monday evening was the best weather I had seen since arriving, the sun was starting to sink, basking the tower in beautiful golds and purples, making for some elegant looking shots. I was taking some longer exposures along the Victoria Embankment when a big red bus came rumbling down the street. I snapped this one just as it went by, one of my favorites from the trip. The tower is framed nicely with the Union Jack fluttering to its side, the double decker bus is just recognizable as it streaks by.</p>

<p>The sun sank lower into the sky so I made my way over to the bridge to set up for another angle. I was delighted to find a Scottish Bagpiper playing for donations, the note in his case saying he was a former soldier asking for 1 pound if you take photos. I snapped some photos and watched him play, then flipped him a 2 pound coin and thanked him.</p>

<p>As golden hour set in a ton of photographers started setting up along the bridge over the Thames, all pointed at the tower. I was mildly disappointed to find that the closest corner of the building didn't have any lights on, creating a very large dark section. Beggars can't be choosers so I kept shooting, capturing this photo. Timing was key here as traffic wasn't that heavy - I had to time my exposures to start after the stoplight turned green allowing the backed up traffic to move towards me instead of sitting and waiting. I took a number of photos from this vantage point, but I picked this one because of the reflection from a bus created an interesting set of light trails on the left side of the frame. </p>

<p>I always say when a group of photographers are looking one way, always at least take a look behind them to see what they are missing, and sure enough thats what I did to capture my favorite image of the trip. Turning around I found the disappearing sun casting a deep blue and purple sky over the Thames river and London Eye. A 30 second exposure blurred out boat traffic on the river and grabbed just enough motion on the ferris wheel. The hotel to the right of the Eye had illuminations that changed colors every minute or so, cycling between blues, yellows, purples, and greens, all adding to the mixture of colors in this scene. The fine details of the exposure are lost here on the screen, but I can't wait to see this one in large format print soon.</p>
<p>Overall the few days I had to explore London went as well as they could have. I got some beautiful shots despite the weather and can't wait for my next trip out. I may post another travelogue, but if you want to see some more shots from the trip, check out my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.197839947031736.1073741833.175762829239448&type=3">Facebook gallery</a>.</p>
