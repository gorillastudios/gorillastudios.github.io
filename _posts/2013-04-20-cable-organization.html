<p>Here's a quick and free tip for cable organization - take those toilet paper tubes that you usually throw away and use them to keep your camera bag cables from tangling up. I always carry a USB sync cable and a wired shutter release remote in my bag and they used to get tangled up with each other or I would have to fidget with twist ties. Now I simply wind the cable on itself and slip it into the tube, and toss it into the bag.  Once the tubes get a little folded and worn they actually flatten a bit and hug the cables even more. Simple.</p>
