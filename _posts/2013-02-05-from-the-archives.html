<p>I spent the weekend going over my backups and consolidating over ten years worth of photos into one complete archive. I made the decision when I got my first camera to keep everything so when I am back at home after a shoot I can go over what worked and what didn't, just like film. This strategy is starting to pay dividends in full, because now I have a ten year archive to sort through and see how far I have come in my craft. I wanted to share one of a handful of shots I took with my original Canon Powershot S200 that re-ignited my passion for photography.</p>

<p>Taken on August 3rd, 2003 in downtown Chicago on one of my first photo walks. I vaguely recall trying very hard to capture some long night-time exposures with a point and shoot, and looking back on the roll I didn't do too bad considering the limitations of the camera. This was from the tail end of the walk - <i>The Spearman</i> is a large bronze statue from 1928, one of two guardians (the other being <i>The Bowman</i>) standing watch at Congress &amp; Michigan Ave in the loop.</p>
