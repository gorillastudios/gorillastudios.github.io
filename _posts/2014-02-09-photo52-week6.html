<p>My trek in week 6 was spent along the frozen banks of the Fox River in Montgomery, IL. Bald Eagles have made a reappearance along the Fox in recent years, coming to town in January and February feeding along the exposed areas of the river. Although we were close, shooting with the Canon 100-400mm lens was tough. I could have easily used another 200mm to get in tighter. During the morning the adult eagles were few and far between although flew overhead a few times, it was mostly the juveniles out feeding.</p>
