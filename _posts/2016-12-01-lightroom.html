<p>I finally made the jump this fall and switched my photography workflow to Lightroom 5 full-time. Since at least 2003 I was using Bridge + Photoshop which I knew was not the most efficient way to do it, but it was comfortable and I was fast with it. When I first checked out Lightroom a few years ago I couldn't quite figure out the way to edit my most recent photos on the go while keeping the bulk of my library at home on my archive drives. After some more thinking, and some inspiration from Martin Bailey, I resolved all my issues and took the plunge.</p>

<p>My photo catalog is quickly racing towards 2TB and while it's certainly not as large as some professionals, it's still big enough to cause headaches. I can't fit my catalog on my laptop, and smart previews just weren't going to cut it. After a little reading and testing I setup a workflow where I could have my cake and eat it too. There is a folder on my laptop called 'To Vault' (The Vault is the name of my archive drive). I import all new photos into that folder, using a simple <code>YYYY-MM-DD - Subject</code> folder structure, then open lightroom and syncronize the folder which imports them into the catalog. Once I am finished editing the photos locally, I then use the Lightroom interface to physically move the source files to The Vault, which is duplicated to another off-site hard drive monthly.</p>
<p>I was finally driven to use Lightroom because I was sick of dealing with maintaining both the source catalog with a 'final edits' collection which took up even more space. Lightroom is non-destructive, which means it saves all your 'edits' in simple xml data files which it then applies to the RAW files when you open them in develop mode, that way the source RAW file isn't touched, and the edits are only a few kb worth of data.</p>
<p>While its completely arbitrary, my rating system has served me well. Three stars is my baseline for anything that has the potential to be added to my portfolio, four stars for gallery images, and five stars are for my absolute master portfolio - a collection of about 18-20 images that span my entire collected works. One and two stars are for family photos and client shoots which stay private excepting for their respective subjects. Using this structure allows me to setup smart galleries where I can quickly find my best work from a given time frame, or other constraint.</p>
