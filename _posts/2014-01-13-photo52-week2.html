<p>This week I ventured out after work to one of my all time favorite Chicago subjects, The Sears Tower. I love how every angle presents a different look at the tower allowing you to keep going back for something different every time. For this particular photo I went to the top of the parking deck just across the street to the east where the 5th floor gives un-interrupted access away from all of the pedestrian traffic below. This was taken at 19mm which still was not enough to get everything, but I like how it turned out. The clouds were flying by at quite a clip, so a 60 second exposure smoothed them out. In color the sky was a brilliant pink with the yellow lights of the building dominating the exposure, but I prefer the high-contrast black and white here.</p>
