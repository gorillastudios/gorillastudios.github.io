<p>Last month I was able to fly out to London for a few days to attend the Future of Web Design conference, and while I was there I had a little bit of time to explore the city and do some photography. This was my second trip out there, so I was a bit more comfortable with getting around and didn't have any issues finding what I was looking for. Leaving Chicago on Saturday evening I arrived at London Heathrow mid Sunday morning and headed straight for my hotel, where I took a short nap just to re-energize myself. After some lunch and a shower I walked down to the Thames and the area around Tower Bridge. Not being in any hurry I kind of explored the area, where I found some interesting architecture and a small water feature cutting through the walkway.</p>

<p>Golden hour was setting in and I was watching the clouds roll in and out, wondering if I was going to get any good shots. There is a quiet little park on the south bank of the river at the Tower Bridge where you have an amazing view of the bridge and Tower of London, so I wandered around there for a bit when the sun burst through the clouds and painted the bridge in a wonderful warm glow. This literally lasted about 30 seconds, so I count myself lucky to have gotten this one.</p>

<p>After that more clouds rolled in, and overall it was a nice quiet sunset. Just after the sun went down I took quite a few shots of the bridge, with my goal being a very large panorama. What I ended up with was this, a 5 shot 180&deg; panorama of the skyline. I like how it turned out, but I resolved to get a better one while I was still there.</p>

<p>After that it was time for some dinner and much deserved sleep, so I headed back to my hotel in Shoreditch, just a few tube stops away.</p>
<h3>Monday</h3>
<p>Monday was another gorgeous day to my surprise, as the last time I was in London I got rained on the first 3 days I was there. I had some free time so I decided to head over towards the area around Westminster where I would walk around wherever I felt like at the time. That meant taking the Circle line from Liverpool Street Station. I love all the train stations downtown, the are very large open air structures with wrought iron and glass roofs mixed with exposed brick walls. Before getting on the train I went up to the balcony over the main terminal and took this quick 3 shot vertical panorama.</p>

<p>Getting off the Circle line at Westminster you come out of the subway literally right underneath Elizabeth Tower. I'm not a huge fan of this stop because the street level is always completely mobbed with tourists and that was certainly the case. As I wound my way through the crowd I looked up to see the sun just starting to poke out from the left side of the tower which made for an interesting shot.</p>

<p>I walked over the river and down to the embankment in front of the Something Hospital where not a lot of tourists go, so I had some time just to sit down and enjoy the view. The clouds were moving at quite a fast rate, exposing the deep blue sky behind them, so I knew I could get a high contrast black &amp; white shot if I was patient enough. After about 15 minutes I took this shot of Elizabeth Tower and the bridge.</p>

<p>Walking back across the river and around a bit more, I stumbled across a large crowd gathering in the Something Something - I knew I had just happened to walk right up to the changing of the guard ceremony, so I stayed around for a few minutes, watching the Household Cavalry put on a small show. The guard had lined up a few feet away from me, and while they were lined up I loved how the uniforms and helmets looked gleaming in the sun.</p>

<p>After grabbing some food I wandered back over towards the London Eye to explore the park at the base, one of the items on my list I didn't get to last time I was in town. Just behind the Eye is a small tree-lined park where I took this.</p>
