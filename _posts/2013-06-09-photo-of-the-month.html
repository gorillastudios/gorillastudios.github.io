<p>My favorite photo taken in May has to be this black and white I took of the Rialto Theatre in Joliet, IL. My brother-in-law was getting married and asked me to take photos of the rehearsal and morning of, which I was more than happy to do. The Rialto is a grand old theatre in the heart of downtown and was a beautiful location to get married. I arrived a little early and decided to grab a few photos of the marquee and signage just to be thorough. During my edits I wasn't exactly thrilled with the outside shots, but when I converted this photo to black and white it really popped. The dark blue sky with a scattering of clouds provide great contrast next along with the bright white 'Rialto' lettering. It just proves that even if you aren't excited when you make the exposure, always be open to pleasant surprises.</p>
