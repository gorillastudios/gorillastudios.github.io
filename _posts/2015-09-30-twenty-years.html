<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The first time I picked up an SLR camera was some time around early 1995. To this day I can't really explain what drew me to it, but I think it has to do with the intersection between art and technology. I was fascinated at how this bulky metal box stuffed with a mirror and mechanical shutter could produce what I was seeing in National Geographic. My freshman year in High School I took Intro to Photography, which to this day is the extent of my formal education in the field.</p>
<p>I dove head first shooting as much as I could while trying not to go broke buying roll after roll of 35mm film. In 1998 my dad purchased a Sony Digital camera that literally used 3.5" floppy discs in the back which held about 10 photos if I recall correctly. Between then and 2003 I used a few different digital cameras but never felt as comfortable as I did with that beat up old Nikon SLR.</p>
<h3>Wanting to get better</h3>
<p>In 2003 I purchased a brand new 6MP Canon EOS 10D Digital SLR and I was on top of the world. The problem was that my ambitions were far ahead of my skill level and I knew it.</p>

<p>"You've got to get rid of a lot of crap before you're going to get anything that's special.  You don't want to be making mediocre stuff.  There's a gap for the first couple years that you're making stuff. What you're making isn't so good. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is good enough that you can tell what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you. A lot of people at that point, they quit. The thing I would say to you with all my heart is that most everybody I know who does interesting, creative work, went through a phase of years where they had really good taste, they could tell what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short. Everybody goes through that. If you're going through it right now, or if you're just starting off and you're entering into that phase, you've got to know its totally normal and the most important thing you could do is a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work because it's only by actually going through a volume of work that you're actually going to catch up and close that gap."<br />

<p>That was exactly where I was. I knew what I wanted to do, I had clear visions in my head of the photos I wanted to take but I couldn't quite get there. When I heard that there was going to be a lunar eclipse I grabbed my tripod and telephoto lens to see what I could get.</p>

<p>I was so dissapointed at the results, I was almost defeated. Everything was blurry, I couldn't get the exposure right, it wasn't in focus, I had so many problems and why? I just spent a ton of money, this should look like it belongs on the cover of Astronomy Magazine right?</p>
