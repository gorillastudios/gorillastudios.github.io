<p>One tool I use quite a bit but never think about is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/synergykm/">SynergyKM</a>, an open-source app that lets you control multiple computers with one keyboard and mouse without a physical KVM switch.</p>

<p>My primary setup is a PowerMac G5 workstation which I do all my photography editing on, but for coding and work I have a PowerBook that travels with me.  When I am home I enjoy being able to use both but I don't want the hassle of switching back and forth between the two. Synergy solves the problem very simply.  The application installs as a preference pane on both machines and setup is easy.</p>

<p>Here I have my PowerMac G5 'Ogden' setup as the server, and my PowerBook 'Asana-2' (why did I name it -2?) setup to the left of my displays.  On the PowerBook I just tell it to look for Ogden and since they are on the same network they connect to each other.  Now I can just swing my mouse over to the left and just like with multiple displays it transfers mouse and keyboard control over to the PowerBook.  When you leave the current computer it takes the mouse cursor and just drops it dead center on the primary screen indicating that its in a kind of 'idle' state.  Mac's and PC's work seamlessly, and you can setup multiple locations as well - I have profiles setup for home and work so when I'm at the office I just switch profiles and it connects to my work PC.</p>

<p>Its open-source so its free, and it removes the clutter of a second keyboard and mouse from the desk which is huge for me since I enjoy a clean work area.  The biggest benefit is that it removes the confusion or mental jump between machines - when you're in a workflow you don't even think about it, it's seamless. Be sure to head over to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/synergykm/">Source-Forge project page</a> and check it out.</p>
