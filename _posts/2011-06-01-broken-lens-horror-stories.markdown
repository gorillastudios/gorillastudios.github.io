<p>Fun little article over on Gizmodo listing some <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5804720/broken-lens-horror-stories">horrifying stories</a> about equipment damage.  It brought to my attention <a href="http://www.borrowlenses.com/">www.borrow-lenses.com</a>, which I have every intention of using sometime in near future.  Remember - always take care of your camera equipment!</p>
