<p>In preparation for an upcoming photo trip to see migrating Sandhill Cranes I wanted to get a monopod so I didn't have to lug my full tripod out into the field.  After some browsing online, I decided to go with the Opteka MP100 67" Monopod.  I couldn't bring myself to spending over a hundred dollars on some high-end brand name kit.  For <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Opteka-MP100-Professional-Heavy-Monopod/dp/B0002RBQO0/">13.50 from Amazon</a> I figured why not try it and see if its a good deal.</p>

<p>The monopod itself is rather sturdy, not completely solid, but well built.  It compacts down very well, with 3 quick release levers for fairly easy adjustments.  I paired it up with an Opteka Ball Head and got amazing results.  I assumed for 13$ it was going to be flimsy and not well constructed, but I was surprised. It held my EOS with battery grip, the ball head, and a large lens very well.  The main advantage of this monopod is that it extends out to 67" which is a must for me considering I stand at 6'6".  With the ballhead I found myself actually lowering the top section a bit to get the camera eye level, which is astounding.</p>

<p>Overall its a well built monopod for an absolute steal.  Its not the most solid constructed unit I have ever seen, but it is a fantastic bargain.  We will see how it holds up to day to day usage in the field.</p>
