Thank you for years of dedication and passion.  When I was tall enough to reach the keyboard I started playing around with my Dad's Apple II, getting lost in the adventure of Oddessy, trekking the Oregon Trail, and discovering a passion that lives on to this day.  My jaw hit the floor when we got our Apple IIGS, color graphics!  A mouse!  Dad and I started learning basic programming together, exploring what we could get that amazing machine to do.  

I was the happiest kid in the world when I got my very own Centris 650, all 30Mhz of its power, all mine!  I was an expert by the time I got a PowerMac 7200.  An iMac, PowerMac G4, and an iBook all followed.  My trusty PowerBook and PowerMac are still my reliable workhorses I use every day.  My wife got me an iPad for my birthday and I was as giddy as I was when I was a kid playing with our Apple II.  

As my passion for photography grew and grew, so did my love of Apple.  Their products allowed me to focus on my work and express my creativity, as Steve said, a true 'bicycle for the mind'.  I would not be able to do what I do if not for Steve Jobs.  I am in awe of all the tributes popping up all over the web today, it truly shows us the world lost a visionary.  

He did make a dent in the universe.

It is with great sadness in my heart that I say 'Thanks Steve'
