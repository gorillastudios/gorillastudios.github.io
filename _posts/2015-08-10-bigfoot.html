<p>This weekend I headed down to Cedar Point IL and had a blast photographing the Bigfoot Bandcamp music festival. If you are looking for a truly unique, laid back and intimate atmosphere, this was the place to be.</p>
<h4>Jaik Wilis</h4>
<p>I wasn't able to get down to the show until early afternoon, but when I arrived Jaik Wilis was taking the stage. I was floored when he opened with a solo acoustic cover of Master of Puppets, beatboxing the rhythm section. Great set and a very unique talent.</p>

<h4>Evacuate The Earth</h4>
<p>Up next was Evacuate The Earth, a three piece band from SOMEWHERE. I love bands that shake things up, and I knew I was in for something special when I the lead singer with a saxaphone, a flute, a bull horn, and her own drum. The bassist had his own theremin which needless to say you don't see very often.</p>

<h4>The Voodoo Fix</h4>
<p>After a short break The Voodoo Fix stormed onto the stage. They recently moved from LA to Nashville where, from what I saw, they are going to make a huge splash in the local scene and well beyond.</p>
