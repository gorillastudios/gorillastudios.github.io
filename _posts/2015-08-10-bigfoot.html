intro: 'My shots from the Bigfoot Bandcamp Festival in central IL'
---
<p>This weekend I headed down to Cedar Point IL and had a blast photographing the Bigfoot Bandcamp music festival. If you are looking for a truly unique, laid back and intimate atmosphere, this was the place to be. The festival was held in a huge campground with the stage in the center so you could literally hop out of your tent and walk right down to the stage. A huge lineup of unique acts combined with a very laid back environment makes this an event you don't want to miss. I have it marked on my calendar for next year already. I got down after the show started, but I got to see Jaik Willis, Evacuate The Earth, The Voodoo Fix, The Krank Daddies, and topping the bill was The Reverend Horton Heat. Throw in some fire dancers, hula hoopers, and a burlesque show, its one of the best festivals I have ever been to.</p>

<h4>Jaik Willis</h4>
<p>I wasn't able to get down to the show until early afternoon, but when I arrived Jaik Willis was taking the stage. I was floored when he opened with a solo acoustic cover of Master of Puppets, beatboxing the rhythm section and pushing his acoustic guitar to the edge. An energetic set and a very unique talent, he was a lot of fun to see.</p>

<h4>Evacuate The Earth</h4>
<p>Up next was Evacuate The Earth. I love bands that don't stick to the routine and I knew I was in for something special when I noticed the lead singer with two saxophones, a flute, a bull horn, and her own drum. The bassist had a theremin which needless to say you don't see very often.</p>

<h4>The Voodoo Fix</h4>
<p>After a short break The Voodoo Fix stormed onto the stage. They recently moved from LA to Nashville where, from what I saw, they are going to make a huge splash in the local scene and well beyond.</p>

<h4>The Krank Daddies</h4>
<p>The Krank Daddies came on stage and tore it up from the first second of their set. You have to respect any band that roars out a song called 'Johnny Cash Kicks Ass'. I had a hard time keeping up with them, but it was a blistering set that left my ears ringing.</p>

<h4>Reverend Horton Heat</h4>
<p>What else can anyone say about the Reverend Horton Heat? He's been rocking since almost before I was born and hasn't lost a step since. I've wanted to see him perform for years which makes it even more special that I got to shoot The Rev, Jimbo, and Paul. A great performance to cap off the night.</p>
