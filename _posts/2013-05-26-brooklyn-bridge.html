<p><a href="http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2013/05/22/130_years_of_brooklyn_bridge_photos_decade_by_decade.php">Curbed.com posted a gallery</a> of one of my favorite architectural icons, The Brooklyn Bridge. Opened in 1883, the gallery has some fantastic photos decade by decade up to the 2000's. Side note, if you are looking for a good book, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Bridge-Building-Brooklyn/dp/1451683235/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1369620166&sr=8-1&keywords=the+great+bridge"The Great Bridge">The Great Bridge</a> by David McCullough, which coincidentally I just finished - it's a great read.</p>
