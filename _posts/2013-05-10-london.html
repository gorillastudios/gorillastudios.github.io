<p>In just a few hours I'll be hopping a plane and headed to London for the <a href='http://futureofwebdesign.com/london-2013/'>Future of Web Design Conference</a>. I will be in England for a week, coming back next Thursday, so there won't be many updates on the site, but keep an eye on my <a href='http://twitter.com/gorilla_studios/'>Twitter</a> and <a href='http://gorilla-studios.tumblr.com'>Tumblr</a> feeds for quick updates and photos if I have time. I plan on taking most of of my free time and shooting as much as I can, sleep be damned. See you next week!</p>
