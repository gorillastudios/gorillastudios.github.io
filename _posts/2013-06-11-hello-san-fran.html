<p>Hello San Francisco! I am in town for a quick business trip and was able to sneak down to the bay for a few minutes today. While I am only here for essentially a few hours I can say it is a beautiful city and I would love to come back and take some time with my camera. Unfortunately I won't be able to head up to the Golden Gate Bridge which is on my photography bucket-list. I snapped this quick panorama of the Bay Bridge on the east side of the city after a fantastic lunch at <a href="http://anchorandhopesf.com">Anchor &amp; Hope</a> which I highly recommend.</p>
