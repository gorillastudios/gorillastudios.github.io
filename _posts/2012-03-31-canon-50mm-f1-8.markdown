<p>I got a chance earlier this week to test out my Canon 50mm f/1.8 in the field for a quick headshot session downtown with our friend Allie. Overall it's a great lens at an absolute bargain that should be in any photographers bag. Amazon has the lens on sale for $117 as of right now.</p>

<p>We had planned to meet up and shoot around 5:30, about an hour before sunset. However Allie got delayed at work which put us back a bit so we were fighting the sun going down. Despite losing daylight rapidly the little 50mm performed very well - I even grabbed some frames at 1/20th all the way open at f/1.8 handheld. Since it is not packing a USM (Ultra Sonic Motor) low-light focusing did become an issue, however it wasn't a deal-breaker though I felt it could perform better. I only mis-focused one or two shots due to the low-light (and that was shooting 1.8 with a very limited depth of field). The lens is super light and some reviews complain that it is built cheaply but I couldn't find any issues with the quality.  The manual focus ring is smaller than most lenses so I can see that being a complaint to someone who likes to use manual control often, but I don't mind it that much.</p>

<p>Here is an un-edited shot taken on my 10D with the 50mm, f/1.8 at 1/20th, hand-held.  As you can see even with an extremely shallow depth-of-field it is very sharp where it needs to be. The bokeh is very smooth so shooting in downtown Chicago at dusk made for some beautiful backgrounds.  We did a basic one-light strobist shoot. I set my Speedlite paired with a wireless trigger on a lightstand with an umbrella which my wife kept from blowing away. Walking around Millennium Park we found some overhead lights in the amphitheater that acted as beauty lights really highlighting her hair, so technically its a two-light setup in this shot.</p>

<p>Hands down this is almost a must buy for anyone who shoots portraits or wants more performance in low-light situations.  It's a well built lens thats <em>very</em> fast, a great bang for the buck. </p>
