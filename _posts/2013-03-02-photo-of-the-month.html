<p>Two months down, still going strong. This month I spent a lot of time out hiking through various forest preserves in the area so my favorite photo this month came from Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve in Darien, IL. I found these waterfalls along a small creek that winds its way through the southern section of the park. A graduated ND filter kept a balanced exposure between the sky and foreground, and a circular polarizer filter cut back reflections from the water to reveal all the rocks and little details underneath. Using both of these also allowed me to extend my exposures up to 2 seconds. I plan on going back in the summer to get one from in the water, but for now its just a bit too cold.</p>
