<p>One of my favorite things to do with the telescope is to chase and photograph the International Space Station, and catching it transiting the moon is a fun challenge that I don't get to try too often. <a href="#" target="blank">My last attempt</a> was all the way back in December of 2018. Needless to say I was excited when I noticed that I had an opportunity coming up in the next few weeks that was only a few minutes from the house, and even better, my cousin's house was right on the path so I didn't have to worry about where to go.</p>
<p>I packed up my gear the night before so I woudln't forget anything when I headed out the door around 4:15 the next morning. Despite it being so early it was rather bright out getting everything setup. I quickly got the mount tracking, and fine tuned the focus, but after that I had some time to contemplate why I don't drink any coffee.</p>

<p>The tranist was set to happen at 05:09:18am, so I pulled up my <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skyview-lite/id413936865" target="blank">SkyView Lite</a> app which tracks the station. At 17,500 mph it moves from horizon to horizon within a few minutes, so you have to pay attention. I saw it behind me fast approaching the horizon at 4:56, and knew it would be on the opposite side of the sky within 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Once it rose above the houses it took me about 10 seconds to find it and start tracking visually. I watched it fly overhead, and then downwards towards the moon, letting me hit the shutter just before the transit. Here's a close up single frame as the station passed.</p>

<p>With my Canon 5D MkIII I was able to get 10 frames. At 45&deg; it wasn't the largest station photo I've taken, but there was still some significant detail. It's always fun to catch the station going by, I highly recommend everyone give it a try.</p>
