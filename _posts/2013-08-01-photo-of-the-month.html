<p>My favorite shot this month was certainly a departure from what I normally like. This was taken on a lunch break while walking around soaking up some sun. I snapped this photo of an apartment building on Adams St. and instantly noticed that from that particular angle no lines were straight up and down. The brick columns were askew, the street lights att odd angles, all creating a strange scene guiding your attention all over the place. I normally like all my photos at perfect 90 degree angles and try my best to correct for the Keystone Effect when shooting skyscrapers (very common living in Chicago) so to say this was outside of my comfort zone is a bit of an understatement.</p>
