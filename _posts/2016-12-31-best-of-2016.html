intro: 'A 10 shot collection of my best work in 2016'

<p>I am continuing my tradition of taking the end of the year to review my photographs taken over the last 365 days, and create a selection of 10 images that represent my best work over that time period. This year was mostly focused on family and work, so I didn't get the chance to shoot as much as possible, but I was able to get some shots from Chicago, Portland, and London which I am very grateful for.</p>
<p>To find my best work I have a smart gallery in Lightroom set to this calendar year + anything thats rated 3 stars or above. At the end of the year I start weeding out weaker shots, taking a few passes to get the collection down to the top 15 or so. This year I started with a set of 56 images, which seems about average for me.</p>

<p>After a few passes I narrowed it down to my 10 strongest. Lets take a look at what I chose, presented chronologically.</p>
<p>Since I work about two blocks from the Sears Tower and its between my office and the train station, I find myself constantly snapping photos and getting different looks at the building. In March when it started warming up a bit I wanted to see what kind of details I could get in the glass bottom viewing platforms using my 70-200 f/2.8. You can't get directly underneath and shoot upwards since there is a large atrium on the west side of the building, so I tried an angle I hadn't seen before. I walked over to the corner of Adams &amp; Wacker Drive, almost completely around the to the side of the building, where I could barely see the west face of the building. From that angle the boxes were very pronounced outwards, combined with the 'shoulders' of the building making some interesting lines. A deep blue cloudless sky turned into a wonderful dark spotlight when converted to black and white.</p>

<p>At the end of March I found myself out in London on business, and while I didn't have much time I was able to sneak out for a late night shoot along the Thames where I took this photo of Millenium Bridge and St. Pauls cathedral. I love the mixture of colors reflecting in the river in contrast to the almost purple night sky.</p>

<p>In May I headed out west to Portland Oregon, and while I was there I ventured out to Cannon Beach. An iconic beach instantly recognizable to anyone who has seen <i>The Goonies</i>, Haystack Rock is a beautiful rock formation over 200 feet tall jutting out of the Pacific coast. I spent two nights shooting sunsets from various spots around the beach, both in and out of the water. My favorite shot was taken at sunset as the tide was creeping in and I could barely feel my toes. The waves breaking over the large rock in the center of the frame combined with how the rip tide washed out the foreground make this one of the best landscapes I have taken in some time.</p>

<p>Another location in Portland I hit was Multnomah Falls just outside Portland. After a serious rain shower cleaned out the tourists I had a few minutes before it filled back up again. Making sure I had my rain gear covering my camera, I got my 16-35 f/4 setup on the tripod and started exposing frames around 1 to 2 seconds as the sun started breaking through the clouds blowing out some shots. Thankfully the sun stayed hidden long enough to get this exposure frames from the top horizon to the base where the white falls reach out into the almost black water below.</p>
