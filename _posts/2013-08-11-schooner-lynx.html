<p>After posting shots from my visit to the Tall Ships exhibit at Navy Pier last week I was contacted by the Captain of the Privateer Lynx regarding the photo I took of it rounding the Chicago Harbor Light in the rain. She is a schooner from New Hampshire that was constructed by Rockport Marine in Rockport Maine and launched on July 28th, 2001. Here is a another photo of this beautiful ship out on Lake Michigan. For more information please visit the ship's website at <a href="http://www.privateerlynx.com/">www.privateerlynx.com</a>.</p>
