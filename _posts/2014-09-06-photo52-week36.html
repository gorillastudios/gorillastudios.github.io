<p>Last week was rather hectic, and now I am proud to post why: I am proud to
introduce Alison Noel. My wife and I welcomed her into the world August 30th at 11:05am.
After an amazing week she is starting to open her eyes and explore the world around
her. I had her laying on her back on my legs while I played with a 50mm macro
lens. She looked straight down the barrel and I snapped her first official
portrait.</p>
