<p>where everything was perfect and way beyond expectation? I did, and it happened to be my wedding day...</p>

<p>Huge thanks to <a href="http://riversidereceptions.com/">Riverside Receptions</a> in Geneva, IL for taking care of everything, having everything setup, ready to go and handling anything that came up.  The service was fantastic, the food was wonderful and the whole day was amazing thanks to them.  Many thanks to <a href="http://aclassactdjservice.com/aclassactdjservice.com/Welcome.html">Andy Fuzak with A Class Act DJ Service</a> for DJ'ing the night and making sure everything flowed well and everyone kept dancing all night!  Also many thanks to <a href="http://www.bellapictures.com/">Bella Pictures</a> and their photographer who captured the special day for us.  I am extremely picky when it comes to photography and they paired us with a true professional - I cannot wait to see the results.</p>

<p>Thank you to all my family and friends who supported us throughout the years and came out to celebrate with us.</p>

<p>And above all, thanks to my blushing bride, I love you so much.</p>
