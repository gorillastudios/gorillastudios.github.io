<p>One month into the Photo365 challenge and I feel it has been going very well so far. The goal when I started wasn't to produce portfolio-worthy images every day - it was mainly to keep practicing my craft while pushing myself to step outside my comfort zone and shoot things I normally wouldn't. Some days were harder than others, but overall it has been thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
<p>A few shots stand out more than others, but the one that caught the most attention was actually completely random.  On January 24th I had to walk from one client to another in the middle of a rather blustery Chicago snowstorm.  I had a vague idea of how to get from A to B, but didn't have a specific route in mind. I just started walking and snapping pictures as I went. A few turns in the general direction I found myself in front of a row of very interesting looking townhomes in the River North neighborhood. Thankfully nobody was parked in front so I took a quick photo and kept walking. </p>

<p>The image was captured at f9.5 at 1/90, ISO 100. I intentionally kept my shutter speed down to catch the snow swirling in front of the lens. I was not sure of exactly how it would show up after processing, but I love how it turned out. I'm undecided if this one will make it to print or portfolio, but it looks beautiful as a desktop image on my Cinema Display. One month down, eleven to go!</p>
