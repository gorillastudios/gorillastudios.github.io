<p>It looks like Wolf Camera is filing for bankruptcy - again.  I stopped by my local store and found out they are closing 'probably half' of their stores.  While they were never able to compete against online retailers in terms of cost, the customer service was always top notch.</p>
<p>I'm not sure exactly which and how many stores are closing, but the one in Batavia, IL is shutting down 'within the month' and is currently having a huge blowout sale.  I picked up about $200 worth of filters for about $40 bucks today.  Most of their inventory is picked clean already, but if you know what you're looking for be sure to stop by.</p>
