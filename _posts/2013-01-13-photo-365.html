<p>As previously mentioned, I have decided to participate in a Photo 365 Challenge.  I will be taking one photo a day for the entire 2013 calendar year, and posting them <a href="/photo365.html">here</a> as well as my <a href="http://gorilla-studios.tumblr.com">Tumblr feed</a>. I wanted to take this challenge so I would have my camera on me at all times, push myself as a photographer, and try some things I haven't done before. So far I am only 13 days in and already I am finding myself seeing things differently, looking for photos everywhere I go.</p>
<p>To make things a bit more challenging, I will limit myself to only a handfull of shots per day.  I have also turned off the automatic preview after each shot as a throwback to the old film days where you don't know your results until your in the dark-room. I'll make monthly posts about my progress, positive notes, frustrations,  etc..</p>
