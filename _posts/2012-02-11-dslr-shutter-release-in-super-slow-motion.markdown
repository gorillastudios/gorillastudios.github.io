<p><a href="http://www.petapixel.com/2012/01/24/a-dslr-camera-shutter-in-slow-motion/">Via PetaPixel</a> - watch straight down the inside of a Canon 60D as the shutter button is pressed. For beginners this is a great way to understand the whole process of how your DSLR actually takes a photo. When you press the shutter release the mirror flips up and the shutter blades then open to expose the sensor to the light coming in from the lens.  After a set time - <em>your shutter speed</em> - the blades snap back into place and the mirror drops down again.  What is really amazing is how fast this process happens - a typical exposure during the day may be around 1/250th to 1/500th of a second.  My old camera can go all the way up to 1/4000th!</p>

<p>This is also a great example why why for long exposures I like to use my <strong>Mirror Lockup</strong> function built into my camera.  As you can see there is an awful lot of vibration as the mirror slams up into place before the shutter opens.  To avoid any of this shake you can 'lock the mirror' in place before the actual exposure. Using my cable release I press the button once to lock the mirror up into place, then press it again to take the actual exposure and release the mirror, avoiding any vibrations that may compromise my photograph. More on that later.</p>
