<p>My personal favorite from June was taken while I was out in California for a few days on a business trip. We had stopped into Anchor &amp; Hope in downtown San Francisco, an amazing seafood restaurant. While waiting for lunch to be served a line cook was shucking oysters behind the main counter. The sun shone in through the skylights and lit him like a spotlight. I wish I had more time to capture the shot, or maybe a wider lens, but I still enjoyed how it came out. I love the decor - with the fun painted fish on the walls and the interesting lamps jutting out, the counter littered with dishes, everything combined to create a visually interesting scene.</p>
