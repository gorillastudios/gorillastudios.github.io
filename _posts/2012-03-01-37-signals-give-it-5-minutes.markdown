<p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes">My favorite blog post</a> from them in a long time, which is saying something because SVN is one of my favorite feeds.</p>

<p><blockquote>So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.</blockquote></p>

<p>I am the exact opposite of how Jason was - I take a lot of time when people pitch ideas and express opinions.  I deliberately wait and think about it, working out my thoughts clearly first.  I let the first round of counter-arguments and crap fly before I open my mouth, that way I can tell who is worth discussing the issue with.</p>
