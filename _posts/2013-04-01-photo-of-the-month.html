<p>My favorite photo for March has to be a very quick shot from Union Station in Chicago. I was a little early for my train so I decided to go up to one of the balconies overlooking the main hall. I had intended to slow my shutter down enough to capture some of the motion from everyone hurrying in and out of the hall but I did not have my tripod. Attempts to use the railing while shooting around 1/10th or 1/8th were unsuccessful, but this shot at f/4.5, ISO 100 for 1/20th was sharp and had no camera shake. Overall I love the photo - in particular the one woman in the foreground seems to stand out to me. I was interrupted when a bride and her photographers came up to the balcony for some shots, however I was more than happy to get out of their way.  I will eventually go back with my tripod and get some long exposures but for now I am happy with this one.</p>
