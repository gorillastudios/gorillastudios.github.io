<p>I have had lots of conversations over the years with friends and younger photographers about upgrading gear, and they always ask about what camera is 'better' or which does X better. As a beginner or amateur photographer guess what? The specs don't really matter. If you listen closely you'll hear the sound of thousands of Internet Trolls crying out <em>'Blasphemy!'</em>.</p>

<p>The other day a friend and I were discussing about what she should get as her first serious DSLR. She told me that the guy at Wolf Camera was going on about how Nikon has better low-light performance, but the Canon optics are better, blah blah blah. She got worried and wanted to know the real-world differences between a few entry to mid-level cameras. These clerks never seem to realize that they are splitting hairs and to a beginner it doesn't matter (and most of the time they don't understand). Do you really think to a beginner (or anyone really) it matters that camera X shoots .5fps faster than camera Y, or its sensor is 3MP more? No. Nobody can tell the difference between a 16MP photo and a 18.5MP photo when they are all uploaded onto Flickr.</p>

<p>I always laugh when car guys are comparing a BMW that can do 180MPh and a Mercedes that can do 182MPh. Yes that Merc is technically faster, but they are both high-performance machines that are really never going to be pushed to their limits. It's the same with cameras - the difference between a Canon EOS 60D and a Nikon D90 is going to be marginal to most beginner and amateur photographers. This Nikon may have 1MP more, or that Canon may be a hair better in low-light sensitivity, but guess what? They are both fantastic cameras that produce great images.</p>

<p>Yes it is an investment and you want to purchase the right camera to fit your needs since you will have it for years (I am *still* shooting with my 10D I purchased in 2003), but don't go overboard wringing your hands about the spec differences between a Rebel T2i and a D5000. Figure out what you want to use the camera for, buy it, and start having fun. Remember: its not the sensor, the lens, or the ultra-high ISO, or some whiz-bang feature that make the photograph - it's your eye, your gut, and your heart.</p>

<p>Stop worrying about all the new cameras coming out and forget about how this camera magazine said brand X was so much better. Instead of sitting in front of a computer reading spec sheets, review after review, and endless forum posts, take that time and go outside with <em>your camera</em>. Take some awesome shots with what you have - share it, talk about your art, and most of all, have fun with it.</p>
