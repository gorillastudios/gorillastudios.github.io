<p>Today I liberated my fathers Celestron Ultima 11" Schmidt-Cass telescope which had been collecting dust for some time. I picked up an adapter for my Canon, so over the next few months I will be seriously exploring astrophotography.  I have previously used a low-grade Quantaray 600-1000mm scope for lunar photography, needless to say this is quite an upgrade - the Celestron has a focal distance of 2800mm (if I understand the specs correctly). I will keep posting my experiences and results soon.  Stay tuned.</p>
