<p>Every year my company hosts the <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org">Software Craftsmanship North America conference</a>, a gathering of professionals in the software industry, located atop the Aeon Center in downtown Chicago. I am lucky enough to be the primary photographer for the two-day event which means I get the chance to soak in the fantastic views from the 80th floor when I am not running around shooting the conference. Since the event is held mid-November each day ends with superlative views of the sun setting over the Chicago skyline. The first night I was able to setup my tripod and get some great still frames like the one below, but I realized this would be the perfect opportunity to make a stunning time-lapse. Only problem is I have never done one.</p>

<p>The basics of time-lapse photography is taking photos at set intervals and stitching them together afterwards to create the a video of stills, the standard rate being 30 frames per second of video. I had a cable release, but it was analog so I couldn't set it to fire at specific intervals - I would have to shoot tethered to the computer. To do so you must install Canon's EOS Utility Software, which *requires* your disc that came with the camera (I'll rant about the inability to download directly from Canon). The utility allows you to control the camera over USB through the computer - allowing live view, focus controls, basic camera functions, as well as continuous interval shooting.</p>
<p>My goal was a longer video, of about 30 seconds, and at 30 frames per second I was going to need to capture 900 photos. I set it to shoot every second, dumping the photos to an external HD attached to my laptop so I wouldn't fill up the cameras SD card. Since I was shooting the sun going down I set the camera to Aperture Priority Mode, dialing it in to f/16. I assumed that since the lighting was going to shift a great deal the camera could recognize that and adjust the shutter speed accordingly. Everything looked great, so I started the series and went about my business.</p>
<p>I would poke my head in every few minutes to make sure everything was going well, and for the first 10-15 minutes everything looked great. I had wanted to catch the sun going down, disappearing, then the city lights coming on as magic hour set in. Unfortunately about 5 minutes after sunset I started looking at some of the exposures and noticed that the ISO was maxed out to 12500 and they were looking terrible. The camera thought it was supposed to be a normally light daylight shot, and therefore started cranking the ISO to get as much light as possible - this was the exact opposite of what I wanted. I had hopped that it would start taking longer and longer exposures, leaving the sky dark and bringing the city lights up as they turned on.</p>

<p>I knew I wasn't going to get exactly what I wanted, but I hoped at least the first portion would be usable. I found a good point to stop at just after the sun dips below the horizon. I batch converted the RAWs into JPGs so I could compile them into a movie. To make the actual movie I found a free utility called <a href="http://www.dayofthenewdan.com/projects/time-lapse-assembler-1/">Time Lapse Assembler</a>. You can choose your target frame-rate, codec to encode with and a few other options. Once the processing finished I got about 11 seconds of okay footage. Its a bit darker than I had hoped for, but overall I'll call it a success. Even though I didn't get the whole lapse I wanted it was a great learning experience. I think my next attempt I will bump the intervals to every 5 seconds and play with the exposure compensation to see what happens. I won't get another chance to shoot from Aeon again until next November, but I will definitely be ready by then.</p>
