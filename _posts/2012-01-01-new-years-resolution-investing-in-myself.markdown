<p>Happy New Year everyone!</p>

<p>Here's to making 2012 a great year. I usually don't make resolutions but this year I will be investing in my photography - dedicating more time and hopefully upgrading equipment as the year goes on. In 2011 I was focused on getting married and working my full time job, so now this year I am going to spend more time learning, shooting and expanding my portfolio. My immediate goal is to at least go out shooting once a week and try to get a portfolio image every month. I want to learn more and hone my skills, I will be really pushing myself and sharing my knowledge and experience here. I have quite a bit planned for the site this year, more post ideas, reviews, critiques and more!</p>

<p>So happy shooting and happy 2012 everyone!</p>

<p>Chris</p>
