    <h1> Week 45 - Mystic River Bascule Bridge</h1>
    <figure>
  <img src="/images/p52/45.jpg">
  <figcaption>Mystic River Bascule Bridge - 5 shot panorama</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I have always wanted to photograph one of my childhood favorites - the Mystic River bascule bridge - and since we are staying in Connecticut for the month I finally have the opportunity. My family owned a dry goods store on the corner here for years, so I have many childhood memories of being around downtown Mystic and specifically watching the bridge raise and lower once an hour - its quite a sight.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rick-sammons-photo-sundial/id689328812?mt=8">Rick Sammon's Photo Sundial app</a> I checked to see when the light would be ideal, and my hunch was correct - just after sunrise the bridge would be bathed in a warm yellow orange light. I forced myself out of bed at 5:45 am and drove downtown, walking around the boardwalk as the sun started creeping over the horizon. Finally around 7:15am the sun was high enough to paint the entire scene with a nice soft light. After playing around with panoramas in week 43 I decided to try it out correctly this time. I shot 5 frames hand-held vertically starting with the bridge to my right, then panning down river to the left. I was sure to overlap my images by about 30% to give Photoshop's photomerge feature enough room to work with while stitching together everything. I carefully aligned each shot to complete an almost 180&deg; shot, making sure to avoid any traffic over the bridge.</p>
<p>I touched up each photo before running the composite, if I didn't photoshop gets confused by the lens vingetting and averages them out to create some ugly dark spots in the sky. For panoramas I prefer to crop down to a 16x9 aspect ratio, it seems better than the custom ultra-wide and short ones artists sell, but more focused than a basic 4x3. I'm not 100% sold on the warping effect of the foreground dock, but overall I love the image and want to print and frame this right away. So much more of New England to get this month!</p>

    <h1> Week 43 - Fall Panorama</h1>
    <figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/panorama.jpg">
  <figcaption>Three image stitched panorama</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This weeks photo was taken from a hiking trail overlooking Eagle Ridge Resort in Galena, IL. My company held a corporate retreat over the weekend, so I had to bring along my camera gear to capture some late fall colors.</p>
<p>The final image is comprised of three separate exposures. While I hauled some photo gear on our hike for portraits, I left the tripod in the car to save weight, not thinking I would do any panoramas (which I rarely shoot). Unfortunately this meant I had to hand hold the camera, while being extremely steady. With any panorama shot it is vital to keep the horizon level in each shot, while overlapping by 20-30% to ensure smooth stitching in post. Once the images are captured I use Adobe Bridge to Photomerge each image into one composite shot. </p>

</figure>
<p>For the best results you should shoot more exposures vertically with a tripod, this gives you room in post to crop down without sacrificing vital portions of the image. You can see above the three images merged into one. In order to create the final image I had to crop out quite a bit from the top and bottom. I do like the final exposure, but it definitely loses a lot when viewed online unless you can zoom in all the way. Ideally this could be printed out to over 40" wide to capture all the detail.</p>

    <h1> Week 41 - Off Camera Flash</h1>
    <figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/phottix-test.jpg">
  <figcaption>Off camera flash &amp; 24" softbox<span>1/160th, f/2.8, ISO1250</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Obviously I have been rather busy the past six weeks, although I would never complain about the work. The baby has been growing like crazy and things are going very well. While I never had any experience in photographing newborns before, I have been through baby-photo boot-camp and come out the other side a little bit more experienced in getting some fun photos of my little one.</p>
<p>With an infant its obvious that you don't want to be firing off a flash in their eyes, but you also want studio quality portraits right from day one, so what do you do? For her first few weeks I did natural light only, taking advantage of the sun shining through the windows when I could, but its difficult. Now that she is moving around a bit more I decided to try a bit of fill light using my new Phottix Ares wireless flash trigger. I mounted it with my Canon 430EX flash on a portable 24" softbox, setting the flash down to 1/64 power, and placing the light stand a few feet behind me while she laid on mommies tummy on the couch. I found shooting anything less than 1/160th was not going to work - she doesn't move a lot, but when she turns or bobs her head it's quicker than you'd expect. ISO was set around 1250, while my 50mm was opened up to f/2.8.</p>
<p>The softbox diffused the light so well Alison didn't bat an eye. Positioning a one-month old is a challenge to say the least - additionally I am super sensitive to make sure I don't upset her, so we pretty much let her do her own thing. She's not sitting up on her own, and propping her up for photos can easily turn a baby cranky very fast - we don't like going that route. Tummy time on a big blanket over mommy makes for a calm baby. While making some funny sounds she lifted her head and looked straight down the lens to make this my favorite photo of the session. When she gets older we can do some more posed shots, and in more of a studio setup, but its still fun to get some while playing around in the living room.</p>

<p>Last week was rather hectic, and now I am proud to post why: I am proud to
introduce Alison Noel. My wife and I welcomed her into the world August 30th at 11:05am.
After an amazing week she is starting to open her eyes and explore the world around
her. I had her laying on her back on my legs while I played with a 50mm macro
lens. She looked straight down the barrel and I snapped her first official
portrait.</p>

    <h1> Week 34 - Bret Michaels</h1>

  <figcaption>Bret Michaels Band - <i>CD &amp; Me August 22nd</i><span>1/250th, f/2.8, ISO3200</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This week proved that you can't give up and hard work eventually pays off. I have been
reaching out to bands, venues, and promoters trying to get into a larger concert for quite
some time now and I finally got in touch with a stage manager who hooked me up with my first
official press pass to see The Bret Michaels Band in Frankfort, IL on Friday night.</p>
<p>It was a medium sized outdoor festival, and to my dismay there was no photo pit. Bret
had sold out the first two rows as part of a meet-and-greet package, and the seats were right
up against the stage - I knew getting in close was going to be a challenge. I used a Canon
70-200mm 2.8 so I knew I had some reach, and combined with my height it wasn't a major issue.
I was able to visualize my shots with a few practice shots of the first opener, and then dial in
my exposure settings during Driven Under's set. The main problem of the evening turned out to be
the red LED lights that were blowing everything out when they turned on, which compromised more than
a few shots.</p>
<p>Just before Bret went on management told me I had a three song limit and then I had to
leave, which is fairly common for big acts so I wasn't shocked. The three songs went by in a blur,
but I was able stay cool and get the shots I wanted. I was on the left side of the stage for the first song
but quickly realized that since Bret is right handed, his hand and mic were covering up most of his
face. When the song ended I quickly darted behind stage and back out to the left side, getting much
better shots. It was a lot of fun to shoot a really professional act, and I think I got some great
pieces for my portfolio. Check out the rest of the shots <a href='/bret-michaels'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Last week I went out with Kodiak, a local folk trio who just love playing
music. They asked to go out and get a few promo shots, as well as some fun
candids of them playing. We walked down to Montrose Beach on Lake Michigan and
they just started playing while I was getting set up. We shot around various locations
as the sun set, so I had to use a Speedlite on a remote trigger as fill light.
I shot with a 70-200mm 2.8 which is kind of an odd choice for group portraits,
but I like using it because I can stand rather far back and let them feel a bit
more natural, its nice not shoving a camera in their faces while they are just
trying to play. Additionally shooting at 3.5 or 4 really compresses and blows
out the background, putting all the focus on the band. It was a ton of fun and
I cant wait to be able to shoot them in concert soon.</p>

</figure>
<p>This week my father and I finally got around to pulling his Porsche Speedster
replica out of the back of the garage, blowing off the dust and firing it up. We
spent the afternoon tinkering around with it and getting it back into running shape
after it sitting since last summer. As a surprise I wanted to take some glamor shots
of it to make a calendar or some framed prints for him, so I dug up my studio lights
and got to work.</p>
<p>I wanted to go for more of a dramatic look where the background fades to black
because I expected to convert most shots to high-contrast black and white, so my key light
was a simple speedlight in a softbox on a light stand. The garage was only light by
a single light bulb on the ceiling, and the lightbox here was right against the passenger
rear tire shooting down into the cab. The steering wheel and gauge cluster look absolutely
fantastic so I grabbed my 50mm macro and shot at f/2.8 to make some really beautiful closeups.
I spent an hour or so shooting the interior, and once we get the car completely cleaned up I
would like to try some full body exterior shots.</p>

    <h1> Week 31 - Meadow Saxifrage</h1>
    <figure>
  <img src="/images/p52/31.jpg">
  <figcaption>Meadow Saxifrage<span>1/125, f/2.8, ISO50</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This week I wanted to mix it up a little bit and try practicing macro work again.
Years ago I bought a Quantaray 50mm macro, and from time to time I like to photograph
flowers and bugs up close. My parents work very hard on their gardens so the backyard
is an absolute playground for someone who wants to do flower-scapes. I grabbed
my gear and headed out to the backyard Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Shooting at 50mm for subjects like this means getting the lens less than an inch or two
from the subject quite often, which means you block out a lot of natural light. To compensate
for this I used my flash off camera on a long cable. This allows me to use the flash hand-held,
giving me the flexibility to orientate it any way I needed. I kept the camera on my Manfrotto
tripod with the center column locked perpendicular to the legs, swinging the camera out over
the flowers instead of trying to make it work as a traditional tripod.</p>
<p>I started with some yellow daisies, but nothing was quite grabbing me. I wanted to get in
extremely close and hopefully wind up with a photo that could be printed and framed. I made
my way around the garden, eventually setting up directly above a large pot full of what I believe
are Meadow Saxifrage. They couldn't have been more than an inch across, so it was going to be
difficult to say the least. I struggled trying not to blow out the petals with the flash while
getting the exposure of the stamen correct, finally settling on 1/125th at 2.8, with the flash
stopped down to 1/32nd power with a puffer defuser, held just to the right of the lens. At 2.8
this close the depth of field was incredibly shallow - the stamen are sharp, as well as the edge
of the right most petal, with a little bit of details on each petal at the center. Two stems
directly underneath add just the right touch to break up what would have been a dull background.</p>

  <img src="/images/p52/30.jpg">
  <figcaption>Head Sculptures, Millenium Park<span>3.2s, f/8, ISO50</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This week I headed back down to Millenium Park in the heart of the Loop to check out
a new art installation just across the pavilion with The Bean. Artist Jaume Plensa has
created four female heads ranging from twenty-one to thirty-nine feet hight, yet only a
few feet wide. You can't tell from this perspective, but they have been skewed so as you walk from
where the photo was taken down towards them you quickly realize they are very thin. It's
quite an optical illusion and draws a large crowd. These three are located just east of
Crown Fountain, while the largest of the four is right on Michigan Ave at the entrance to
the park.</p>
<p>I had a difficult time shooting because the lighting just wasn't there. It was getting
very dark and I had hoped to pick up the buildings in the background, but the foreground
lighting just wasn't enough to balance the exposure. This is one of the earlier shots from
before sunset. I brightened up the trees to almost an infra-red like photo to create some
contrast. I am definitely going to go back to see what other kinds of photos I can get,
it really is something to check out if you are in the Loop.</p>

    <h1> Week 29 - Archways</h1>
    <p>A few months ago while working at a client's office downtown, I used to go for walks at lunch
to explore the neighborhood and one day stumbled across Mary Bartelme Park. Located just west of the
loop it's a wonderful park with a playground, dog play area, and on the west end, a very interesting
piece of art. A series of five steel or aluminum archways at various angles stand about 12 ft square,
and are equipped with nozzles that spray a fine mist of water to cool off patrons during the hot
Chicago summers. While there I snapped a few photos with my iPhone and told myself to come back at some
point to shoot with my SLR. A few nights ago I finally got the chance.</p>
<p>As I always say preparation goes a long way so I wanted to get there before sundown to set everything
up and make sure I had my composition locked in. I wanted to shoot very low to exaggerate the angles of
the arches, so I set my Manfrotto as low as it would go with the neck flipped at a 90 degree angle, the bottom of the camera only a few inches off
the pavement.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/arch-prep.jpg">
  <figcaption>Preparation is key</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As the sun finally settled below the horizon and the lights came up, the sky faded to a beautiful purple
blue hue with a touch of pink to the south. The ideal lighting was only around for about fifteen to twenty
minutes so I knew I had to get something relatively quickly. I loved the colors of the shots I was taking,
but it was really lacking something. I had expected the water to be misting from the arches, however when
anyone tried to turn it on nothing happened. I'm not sure where the idea came from, but I thought this would
be the perfect opportunity to try some light painting - problem was I don't carry a flashlight in my day pack.
Undeterred, I set the camera to a 10 second timer, turned on my iPhone flashlight, and proceeded to walk back and forth
waiving it with the flashlight towards the camera. My first exposure was just arcs headed from back to front -
not as dramatic as I was hoping for, but the light was showing up crystal clear. I fired off another ten
exposures or so, wildly waving my arm and running back and forth each time (what a workout). I
eventually got exactly what I wanted - windmilling the phone like Pete Townshend while slowly walking towards
the camera created this weeks photo. Probably the most unique and fun photo I have ever taken.</p>

</figure>
<p>No matter what I do I can't stop taking photos of the Sears Tower, I've probably surpassed the thousand mark a while ago.
It doesn't help that I work just a few blocks from it, and on some days I like to go for a walk during lunch with my camera.
I've said before that I love taking photos of it because you can get dramatically different shots from all angles of the
building. I wanted to see if I had enough reach at 200mm to see people in the skyboxes that jut out from the west side of
the tower over Wacker Drive. This particular angle was from the north west corner on the pedestrian island out front. I
particularly like that you can't instantly figure out what you are looking at, and its certainly not a photo of the Sears I
have seen before. There is a very subtle lens flare from the afternoon sun taking up the right side of the exposure, but I
feel it adds a bit of warmth and character.</p>

<p>I already wrote a long post about my 4th of July weekend, so I want to keep this one brief. I selected another shot
from our family fireworks display in Indiana as my photo of the week. This is very close to what I had in mind when I
setup my tripod - I wanted a wide shot with the fireworks going off from in back of the house with a few people in frame
if possible. On my full-frame 5D MkIII at 19mm I was just shy of capturing the entire ark, but I love the overall exposure.
Great evening with the family.</p>

  <img src="/images/adult-bald-eagle.jpg">
  <figcaption>June 29th - Adult Bald Eagle<span>1/320, f/4.5, ISO100</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Taking a break from cityscapes and architecture, this week I packed up my gear and headed back out into nature. A friend and I
went out for a morning shoot around the Fox River with no particular goal in mind, however we chanced upon two fisherman who told
us that some bald eagles had nested north of us in Mooseheart, where the juveniles were getting ready to fly for the first time.</p>

<p>Arriving at the location it was obvious where the nest was. Bald eagles have the largest nest size of any bird in North America,
or possibly anywhere period. I estimate it was probably a good 8-10 feet around, and equally as deep. The juvenile bald eagle is a
very dark brown with a few white feathers poking out at various spots on their body. Their heads are not white, nor are their beaks
yellow until adulthood, which is at about 5 years old or so. It was very difficult to get any clean photos of the juveniles since
the pine tree was fairly thick.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of watching them we noticed an adult in an adjacent tree staring at us very closely. There is very little
difference between the male and females, the only distinct difference being size - the females tend to be about 25% larger than the
males. Judging by the size I presume this was the father. He hopped around a little bit when we spotted him presumably to watch us
closer, but didn't move apart from that. I took this with a 70-200mm 2.8, and this is a 100% crop which tells you how high up he was.
I shouldn't be surprised, but I was taken aback at how good their eyesight was. On exposure after exposure you could plainly see they
were watching us extremely closely - constantly looking right down the barrel of the lens. These are truly majestic creatures and I
hope to get a chance to photograph them flying and feeding at the river.</p>

  <figcaption>June 19th - Manhattan<span>80s, f/9, ISO400</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This weeks Photo52 challenge was, obviously, taken during my <a href="/2014/06/23/NYC/">trip to NYC</a> last weekend. This shot was from the first night down in Brooklyn, just across from the southern tip of Manhattan. Brooklyn Bridge Park is a gorgeous location on the west side of Brooklyn overlooking the river and there are so many great locations for shooting the skyline. This location is on the far south of the park, where there is a dilapidated boat launch surrounded by these wooden posts poking out of the water. I knew if I could open the shutter long enough to smooth out the water it would be a great effect. As the sun dipped below the horizon there were some really ugly clouds that took up the right side of the sky, but at the last minute they finally cleared. I had a 2 stop neutral density filter on a Canon 16-35mm f/2.8 wide angle lens, and was exposing for 2-4 minutes each.</p>
<p>This particular exposure was taken at 80 seconds and since it was at f/9 the streetlights on the horizon didn't turn into giant starbursts like they would at lower f-stops. The composition is probably my favorite part of this - the wooden posts and clouds all lead you right into the center and right side of the frame where One World Trade Center is standing tall. I was hoping to get the Statue of Liberty in the left side of the frame, but there was a large open air sports complex off camera left jutting out into the river that blocked her. Hopefully I can go back and explore NYC again soon, there is so much to capture and nowhere near enough time.</p>

</figure>
<p>Since I have found it difficult to keep up with the Photo52 project over the past few weeks I have been using my iPhone to try to get at least a photo a day. In doing so I have been exploring a few tools to really see what I can capture with it. Until recently I haven't been blown away by anything other than the convenience of having it in my pocket at all times. I have started using <a href="http://www.instagram.com/gorillastudios">Instagram</a> quite a bit, which originally I hadn't cared for all that much. Instagram has released a new version of the app with better editing controls, really expanding (at least in my opinion) what it can do. I also purchased an app called <a href="http://vsco.co/vscocam">VSCOcam</a> which I am very pleased with (more on those later). One thing I have found in using my iPhone every day is that its a great scouting tool to let me almost 'sketch' out ideas for shots before returning with my SLR. That is exactly what happened this week.</p>
<p>Since I commute into the city each day I get to see a lot of beautiful architecture, and of course every day I get to walk through Union Station. The Great Hall is gorgeous, but there are some interesting spots outside the building as well. This photograph is looking south from the east exit of the main building. If you turn facing north there is a big ugly view of a CVS sign through the archway, so I prefer this angle. The lines can be tricky, however scouting the day before helped me get the shot I wanted very quickly.</p>

Lately we have been getting some spectacular sunsets here in Chicago so I decided to head out and see what I could get on a very windy Thursday afternoon. I picked up a Divvy bike just around the corner from my office and headed down to the lake. To say it was windy is an understatement. It was close to 70 in the afternoon, but after a half hour I was uncomfortably cold. Not much really grabbed me as there was a pretty thick haze over the city, so I grabbed another Divvy and peddled my way around the Field Museum campus just to kill some time before sundown. A side note, I now consider a Divvy key fob to be an essential part of any Chicago-based photographers toolkit. Instead of lugging my gear all over the loop I was able to just pull a bike and head to where I want with very little effort.</p>
<p>After circling Solider Field and the Shedd Aquarium I braved the bitter wind and went back down to the lake by the Adler Planetarium, one of the best spots in the city to see the skyline. The haze started to part, but when the sun started dipping below the buildings it ducked down right behind 311 S. Wacker to create these beautiful sunbeams casting past the Sears Tower and right over the lake. I wanted to get in tight so I switched to my 55-200mm and shot that wide open at 55. I love the sun bursting out from the buildings, the silhouette of the skyline is much different than most shots with all of the lights on. I like how this one turned out.</p>

    <h1> Week 8 - Chicago By Train</h1>

<p>I have been taking a series of photos during my morning commute into the city from the train, and this weeks entry is my favorite from the past few days. While very similar to Week 1, this time I decided to slow my shutter speed down to introduce some motion blur in the foreground while keeping the subject and background sharp. After pulling the photo into Lightroom it looks like I panned from left to right to keep the water tower in frame, dragging the exposure a bit - the consequence of this is that the water tower is sharp, the foreground is extremely blurred, and the background is just barely blurred. This panning technique is used by photographers to keep very fast moving subjects in focus while blurring out the background, emphasizing motion.</p>

<p>I love to take photos nobody else has or would, which means putting myself through some uncomfortable situations at times. When another 5-8 inches of snow was forecast I saw a great opportunity to capture something unique while most sane people were bundled up at home. Leaving work and heading down to Millenium Park I got blasted in the face with snow no matter which direction I walked making me almost throw in the towel a few times. Since I don't have a weather cover I had to keep my camera tucked up underneath my coat while not shooting to keep the camera relatively dry and the lens clear. I quickly pulled the camera out when I found these two people were the only ones having fun underneath the sculpture, snapping this exposure as the woman reached out to touch it. I really love the sense of scale - the silhouette effect really adds to the sense of how large the sculpture really is.</p>

<p>My trek in week 6 was spent along the frozen banks of the Fox River in Montgomery, IL. Bald Eagles have made a reappearance along the Fox in recent years, coming to town in January and February feeding along the exposed areas of the river. Although we were close, shooting with the Canon 100-400mm lens was tough. I could have easily used another 200mm to get in tighter. During the morning the adult eagles were few and far between although flew overhead a few times, it was mostly the juveniles out feeding.</p>

<p>Another chilly evening in Chicago, but this time I went down to Millenium Park. While there are ropes around Pritzker Pavilion I didn't feel too bad stepping over since there were already tracks through the snow and the security guard by the Bean seemed pretty engrossed in his smartphone. I jogged out to the center of the field and snapped a few shots trying to frame the bandshell, Aon Tower and the overhead beams as carefully as I could. I love the colors and how sharp this photo turned out. Worth getting a boot-full of snow.</p>

<p>While trying to determine my next lens purchase I decided to rent Canon's 17-40mm f/4 wide-angle zoom lens this week to test it out in the field. I went for an extremely cold walk along the Chicago River and around Michigan Ave getting a feel how it performs. It did great wide open at 17mm and was tack sharp at f/10 with no noticeable issues. I would love to try something in the neighborhood of 14mm, but this is a great general purpose wide-angle. This was my favorite from the walk this week - the river was frozen over and the lights were just starting to come on as the sun disappeared behind the camera. Its tough shooting so wide because of the vertical distortion from the buildings, but if you keep that in mind while shooting you can give yourself some room to fix in post.</p>

    <h1> Week 3 - Picasso</h1>

<p>Week 3 was the coldest photo I think I have taken in a long time due to the fact that we  are in the middle of another cold snap in Chicago. Despite the weather I layered up and ventured out for a walk through the city after work. At first I tried taking some long exposures on two bridges over the Chicago river but the vehicle traffic was shaking the camera too much so I moved on. After winding my way around the Loop I came to the Daley Center and found a group of bikers at the base of the Picasso sculpture  meeting up for a very chilly evening ride. They weren't in any hurry despite how cold it was so I took some longer exposures to get the bikes stationary while the riders were walking around talking to one another. They didn't seem to mind being photographed at all so I kept getting closer, at one point a few of them waved at the camera. This is one of the last exposures I got as they were getting ready to ride off into the night. I liked this particular frame because the bikes are in different states of opacity due to the movement.</p>

<p>This week I ventured out after work to one of my all time favorite Chicago subjects, The Sears Tower. I love how every angle presents a different look at the tower allowing you to keep going back for something different every time. For this particular photo I went to the top of the parking deck just across the street to the east where the 5th floor gives un-interrupted access away from all of the pedestrian traffic below. This was taken at 19mm which still was not enough to get everything, but I like how it turned out. The clouds were flying by at quite a clip, so a 60 second exposure smoothed them out. In color the sky was a brilliant pink with the yellow lights of the building dominating the exposure, but I prefer the high-contrast black and white here.</p>

<p>Week 1 was a continuation of my series of silhouette shots I was getting from my train ride into the city every morning. My primary goal was the Sears Tower shot I had been working on, but I took this photo as we were passing through Forest Park. It doesn't have the sun bursting out like the others, and the blue tint of the train window really made this photo work.</p>
