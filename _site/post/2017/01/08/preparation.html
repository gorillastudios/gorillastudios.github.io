    <p>On August 21st of this year there will be a full solar eclipse passing over the central United States, with the center linel cutting through southern Illinois. Since this will only be a few hours south of me, I will be driving down and photographing the event. The last one I can recall was in the early 90's and I was in middle school, so I am quite looking forward to seeing this.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>You can't shoot the sun without heavy filters on your camera so I ordered a black polymer filter sheet from <a href="http://www.thousandoaksoptical.com/solar.html" target="blank" alt="Thousand Oaks Optical solar filters and accessories">Thousand Oaks Optical</a> to use with my 600-1000mm lens. A lot of sites recommend you just rubber band the sheet over the end of the lens but I wanted a nicer (and re-useable) solution than that. I have a 100mm square filter holder for my regular ND filters, so I decided to put together some kind of insert for the sheet to slip inside my holder.</p>
<p>My ND filters are 100mm squares and only 1 or 2mm thick, so the challenge is to make something rigid enough to 'frame' the solar filter yet thin enough to slip into the holder. I poked around with a few different kinds of cardboard but everything was too thick or too flimsy until while getting breakfast the other day I grabbed a box of Cheerios and realized the cardboard was absolutely perfect. Rigid and thin, I could cut two pieces out and using an exacto knife cut a window for the filter.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The edges didn't have to be perfect since they were outside the field of view plus this will probably be proof of concept until I can find a better material. I cut down the solar filter sheet and taped it into the frame, then taped the two frames together.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/IMG_3657.jpg" alt="Filter sheet inside the frame" />
</figure>
<p>The sheet is delicate and even though I was careful I somehow scratched the front of it. Not a big deal, the sheet itself was only a few bucks. I put everything together and mounted it in the filter holder attached to my lens making sure the silver side is facing the sun.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The solar filter is so dark that the sun is the <i>only</i> thing you can see when its mounted so getting the camera aligned with the sun and focused is a bit of a trick without burning out my left eye. I found that when I squint while shooting with my right eye behind the camera my left eye is still kind of open, enough to where if I am pointing at the sun its very uncomfortable. I slid my hat down over my left eye and kept the right behind the camera so I was safe. Focusing was tricky, but I got dialed in and started making exposures. To my surprise I had to bump my ISO to 800 while shooting 1/250th of a second but I figure I can probably drop my shutter speed a bit when it's on the tripod. I will probably grab a blanket or some kind of hood on my next test run so I can use live view to get even sharper focus.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Next up is to search for a better material to use as a filter frame, however if I don't find anything I know that using this simple method works just fine. I'd also like to try using a hood over the tripod so I can focus better without getting blinded in the process. Remember you have to be very careful while viewing or photographing the sun, as even a second or so of direct contact can damage your eyes or equipment. I'll post some more updates as I make progress.</p>
