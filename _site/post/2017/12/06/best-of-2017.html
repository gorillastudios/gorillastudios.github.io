    <p>Another year has come and gone which means again it's time to look back and choose my best ten shots from the 2017 calendar year. I've done this for the past few years and find it to be a wonderful learning experience as well as extremely rewarding.</p>

<p>To find my best work I have a smart gallery in Lightroom set to this calendar year + anything thats rated 3 stars or above. At the end of the year I start weeding out weaker shots, taking a few passes to get the collection down to the top 15 or so. This year I started with a set of 48 images, which seems about average for me.</p>

<p>As I get closer to the final 10 things start to get tricky. Editing photos, in the context of creating a body of work, not actually adjusting exposure, colors, etc.., means making some hard decisions about what to include and what to leave out. Time usually makes this easier - photos you were in love with right after they were taken don't seem as exciting, and sometimes others that might not have grabbed your attention stand out now. David DuChemin has a wonderful video in his Craft &amp; Vision series regarding this, I recommend watching it.</p>
<p>After much deliberation I finally narrowed it down to my top 10 from the 2017 calendar year. They are presented in chronological order.</p>

<p>My day job is in the Chicago Loop, which gives me some great opportunities to do architecture photography. Whenever I am walking to and from the train station I keep my eyes open, some days taking detours and alternate routes for fun. I have been creating a series of photographs taken at 16mm straight up of the skyscrapers around the Loop, but it's difficult not to have power lines, light poles, or other distractions in frame. I had mainly stuck to Wacker Drive around Monroe, but one afternoon I wandered down around Dearborn and Madison where I found a small alley across from the Chase building. Looing up I realized I had stumbled onto something with a lot of potential.</p>

<p>For some reason I find it rather difficult getting these shots, because when I lean back and point the camera straight up I start losing my balance. I have to plant my legs wide open and make sure I'm not too close to traffic, I don't want to keel over into the street. Despite the difficulties I love the perspective a super-wide angle gets pointing straight up, watching the buildings almost dissapear into the sky.</p>

<p>In late July we packed up and we headed out to Connecticut for a much needed break while visiting family. Spending a week in Mystic and the surrounding areas is a great way for me to recharge my batteries and try my hand photographing subjects I just can't in Illinois. One of my all time favorite photographers is <a href="http://vanderwal.com" target="blank">Onne Van Der Wal</a> who has an amazing gallery in Newport Rhode Island, and he shoots boats and other nautical subjects. I always think of him when I'm out on the water with my camera.</p>

<p>September 21st had been circled on my calendar for a few years, so to say I was excited was a bit of an understatement. I packed all my gear up, including my tracking mount for my telescope, and headed down to Fulton, Missouri in order to view the eclipse right on the path of totality. The day was intensely hot and clouds were threatening us all morning, but everything stayed clear during the partial phases and most importantly during totality. This shot is a composite of I think 9 exposures to capture the details radiating outwards.</p>
