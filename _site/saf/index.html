  <h3>Christopher Peak</h3>
  <p>My name is Christopher Peak and I am a loving father &amp; husband, web-developer, and photographer from Chicago, IL. I have been a landscape &amp; nature photographer since high school but I have always loved taking portraits of friends and family. Since my daughter was born in August of 2014 I have spent all my free time playing with her, making her laugh, and taking candid portraits. She truly has awakened my love of portraiture and I want to share my talent with other families by offering my services on a professional level. Taking photos of her almost every day allows me to practice one of the most important aspects of candid portraits - capturing that special moment that can come and go in an instant - the little laugh, the smile, or simple look someone gives. When I record those moments it makes me smile ear to ear, and I can enjoy them for the rest of my life.</p>
  <h4>Artist Statement</h4>
  <p>From the very first time I picked up a camera my goal has always been to create incredible and bold images. I do my best to stand out and strive to stay true to my own unique style. My goal is to eventually incorporate and be able to use my talents to delight my clients with portraits that capture the subject with simplicity and emotion.</p>

  <h4>What I've Done</h4>
  <p>I launched my photography website, Gorilla-Studios, in 2003 as a simple place to showcase my portfolio as well as practice my web design skills. Over the years I have shot weddings for close friends, concerts for various musicians &amp; bands, and headshots here and there. A photograph of the night sky over Watch Hill, Rhode Island was recently featured in the Watch Hill Conservation Society's quarterly newsletter, and a print of the schooner <i>Lynx</i> in a rain storm on Lake Michagan was requested by her captain for their use.</p>
  <p>Most recently I completed a commission for an art consulting firm in Ontario looking for architectural photos to use in a new 250 room hotel being built.</p>

  <h4>How I would use this award</h4>
  <p>I pride myself on having a skilled eye for photography but I have also worked very hard over the last 20 years to reach this level. My friends and family have urged me to incorporate and start taking on more paid work, and while that has always been a long term goal of mine, the state of my equipment does not allow me to do so. I recently upgraded to a professional level camera body but I only have one 50mm f/2.8 lens that is capable of professional results. My wide angle and zoom lenses were purchased over 10 years ago - both of which are starting to fail at this point, which means they are not usable for client work.</p>
  <p>My goal is to finally invest in myself - incorporating my business and equipping myself with the proper tools to deliver professional results consistantly. Ideally I could transition from full-time web development to part time, dedicating the rest of my time to photography.</p>
