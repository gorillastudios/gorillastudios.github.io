    <figure>

</figure>
<p>This week I headed back down to Millenium Park in the heart of the Loop to check out
a new art installation just across the pavilion from The Bean. Artist Jaume Plensa has
created four female heads ranging from twenty-one to thirty-nine feet hight, yet only a
few feet wide. You can't tell from this perspective, but they have been skewed so as you walk from
where the photo was taken down towards them you quickly realize they are very thin. It's
quite an optical illusion and draws a large crowd. These three are located just east of
Crown Fountain, while the largest of the four is right on Michigan Ave at the entrance to
the park.</p>
<p>I had a difficult time shooting because the lighting just wasn't there. It was getting
very dark and I had hoped to pick up the buildings in the background, but the foreground
lighting just wasn't enough to balance the exposure. This is one of the earlier shots from
before sunset. I brightened up the trees to almost an infra-red like photo to create some
contrast. I am definitely going to go back to see what other kinds of photos I can get,
it really is something to check out if you are in the Loop.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2014/07/22/photo52-week29/">Week 29 - Archways</a></h1>
    <p>A few months ago while working at a client's office downtown, I used to go for walks at lunch
to explore the neighborhood and one day stumbled across Mary Bartelme Park. Located just west of the
loop it's a wonderful park with a playground, dog play area, and on the west end, a very interesting
piece of art. A series of five steel or aluminum archways at various angles stand about 12 ft square,
and are equipped with nozzles that spray a fine mist of water to cool off patrons during the hot
Chicago summers. While there I snapped a few photos with my iPhone and told myself to come back at some
point to shoot with my SLR. A few nights ago I finally got the chance.</p>
<p>As I always say preparation goes a long way so I wanted to get there before sundown to set everything
up and make sure I had my composition locked in. I wanted to shoot very low to exaggerate the angles of
the arches, so I set my Manfrotto as low as it would go with the neck flipped at a 90 degree angle, the bottom of the camera only a few inches off
the pavement.</p>

<p>As the sun finally settled below the horizon and the lights came up, the sky faded to a beautiful purple
blue hue with a touch of pink to the south. The ideal lighting was only around for about fifteen to twenty
minutes so I knew I had to get something relatively quickly. I loved the colors of the shots I was taking,
but it was really lacking something. I had expected the water to be misting from the arches, however when
anyone tried to turn it on nothing happened. I'm not sure where the idea came from, but I thought this would
be the perfect opportunity to try some light painting - problem was I don't carry a flashlight in my day pack.
Undeterred, I set the camera to a 10 second timer, turned on my iPhone flashlight, and proceeded to walk back and forth
waiving it with the flashlight towards the camera. My first exposure was just arcs headed from back to front -
not as dramatic as I was hoping for, but the light was showing up crystal clear. I fired off another ten
exposures or so, wildly waving my arm and running back and forth each time (what a workout). I
eventually got exactly what I wanted - windmilling the phone like Pete Townshend while slowly walking towards
the camera created this weeks photo. Probably the most unique and fun photo I have ever taken.</p>

</figure>
<p>No matter what I do I can't stop taking photos of the Sears Tower, I've probably surpassed the thousand mark a while ago.
It doesn't help that I work just a few blocks from it, and on some days I like to go for a walk during lunch with my camera.
I've said before that I love taking photos of it because you can get dramatically different shots from all angles of the
building. I wanted to see if I had enough reach at 200mm to see people in the skyboxes that jut out from the west side of
the tower over Wacker Drive. This particular angle was from the north west corner on the pedestrian island out front. I
particularly like that you can't instantly figure out what you are looking at, and its certainly not a photo of the Sears I
have seen before. There is a very subtle lens flare from the afternoon sun taking up the right side of the exposure, but I
feel it adds a bit of warmth and character.</p>

  <figcaption>July 5th - Fireworks with the family<span>5s, f/5.6, ISO1000</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I already wrote a long post about my 4th of July weekend, so I want to keep this one brief. I selected another shot
from our family fireworks display in Indiana as my photo of the week. This is very close to what I had in mind when I
setup my tripod - I wanted a wide shot with the fireworks going off from in back of the house with a few people in frame
if possible. On my full-frame 5D MkIII at 19mm I was just shy of capturing the entire ark, but I love the overall exposure.
Great evening with the family.</p>
