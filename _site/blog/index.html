</figure>
<p>This week proved that you can't give up and hard work eventually pays off. I have been
reaching out to bands, venues, and promoters trying to get into a larger concert for quite
some time now and I finally got in touch with a stage manager who hooked me up with my first
official press pass to see The Bret Michaels Band in Frankfort, IL on Friday night.</p>
<p>It was a medium sized outdoor festival, and to my dismay there was no photo pit. Bret
had sold out the first two rows as part of a meet-and-greet package, and the seats were right
up against the stage - I knew getting in close was going to be a challenge. I used a Canon
70-200mm 2.8 so I knew I had some reach, and combined with my height it wasn't a major issue.
I was able to visualize my shots with a few practice shots of the first opener, and then dial in
my exposure settings during Driven Under's set. The main problem of the evening turned out to be
the red LED lights that were blowing everything out when they turned on, which compromised more than
a few shots.</p>
<p>Just before Bret went on management told me I had a three song limit and then I had to
leave, which is fairly common for big acts so I wasn't shocked. The three songs went by in a blur,
but I was able stay cool and get the shots I wanted. I was on the left side of the stage for the first song
but quickly realized that since Bret is right handed, his hand and mic were covering up most of his
face. When the song ended I quickly darted behind stage and back out to the left side, getting much
better shots. It was a lot of fun to shoot a really professional act, and I think I got some great
pieces for my portfolio. Check out the rest of the shots <a href='/bret-michaels'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Last week I went out with Kodiak, a local folk trio who just love playing
music. They asked to go out and get a few promo shots, as well as some fun
candids of them playing. We walked down to Montrose Beach on Lake Michigan and
they just started playing while I was getting set up. We shot around various locations
as the sun set, so I had to use a Speedlite on a remote trigger as fill light.
I shot with a 70-200mm 2.8 which is kind of an odd choice for group portraits,
but I like using it because I can stand rather far back and let them feel a bit
more natural, its nice not shoving a camera in their faces while they are just
trying to play. Additionally shooting at 3.5 or 4 really compresses and blows
out the background, putting all the focus on the band. It was a ton of fun and
I cant wait to be able to shoot them in concert soon.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2014/08/15/ferguson-chicago/">NMOS14 - Chicago</a></h1>
    <p>Last night a rally was held at Daley Plaza here in Chicago to show solidarity with
the people of Ferguson, MO. The demonstration centered around a moment of silence at 6:20pm.
Here are some of my photographs presented without comment.</p>

</figure>
<p>This week my father and I finally got around to pulling his Porsche Speedster
replica out of the back of the garage, blowing off the dust and firing it up. We
spent the afternoon tinkering around with it and getting it back into running shape
after it sitting since last summer. As a surprise I wanted to take some glamor shots
of it to make a calendar or some framed prints for him, so I dug up my studio lights
and got to work.</p>
<p>I wanted to go for more of a dramatic look where the background fades to black
because I expected to convert most shots to high-contrast black and white, so my key light
was a simple speedlight in a softbox on a light stand. The garage was only light by
a single light bulb on the ceiling, and the lightbox here was right against the passenger
rear tire shooting down into the cab. The steering wheel and gauge cluster look absolutely
fantastic so I grabbed my 50mm macro and shot at f/2.8 to make some really beautiful closeups.
I spent an hour or so shooting the interior, and once we get the car completely cleaned up I
would like to try some full body exterior shots.</p>

  <figcaption>Recesky 35mm TLR Camera Kit</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I've always wanted an original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolleiflex">Rolliflex Twin Lens Reflex camera</a> but could never pull the trigger due to the cost
of one in good condition. I was poking around Amazon a few weeks ago and found some replica kits for only $25, so I
added it to my wish-list. Lo and behold one arrived at my door a few days after my birthday! The kit comes completely
disassembled, with a screwdriver and a single roll of 35mm ISO200 film.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/rolliflex-assembly.jpg">
  <figcaption>Assembly</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Opening it up I was rather surprised <i>how much</i> assembly was required. Everything down to the shutter was
in pieces, and unfortunately the instructions were obviously translated into English, meaning they were about as
clear as mud. Thankfully I know my way around a film camera so everything was fairly easy to figure out, the biggest
problem was that two of the shutter springs were mis-labelled. Once I figured that out assembly wasn't too bad.</p>
<p>The quality is exactly what you would expect from a $25 dollar kit. Everything is plastic and on the flimsier side,
but as completed kit it holds up okay. I will load it up with film and pick something to shoot in the next few days.
Stay tuned for the results.</p>
<p>Check out the kit at Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004PALJBA/">here</a>.</p>
