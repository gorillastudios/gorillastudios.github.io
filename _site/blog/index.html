    <h1><a href="/2014/11/16/photo52-week46/">Week 46 - Sunset at Masons Island</a></h1>
    <figure>
  <img src="/images/portfolio/masons-dock.jpg">
  <figcaption>Sunset on Mason's Island<span>8s, f/22, ISO50</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Being out in Connecticut, specifically right down on the coast, one thing we get here is spectacular sunsets. I have been going out every few days and photographing the sun as it dips below the horizon out over the water. Since its closer to wintertime the track of the sun heads a bit more south than the winter months, which is perfect for shooting out over the Atlantic ocean. For this week's trek I ventured down to another childhood favorite, Mason's Island in Stonington CT.</p>
<p>Mason's Island looks out over Fishers Island Sound, Block Island Sound, and right out into the Atlantic. You can see Noank to the west all the way around to Watch Hill, Rhode Island to the east. It was a crystal clear afternoon as I grabbed my gear and started looking for places to shoot. As the sun was going down I started shooting straight down the dock, then off to the side silhouetting a smaller finger dock against the sun, but it wasn't quite grabbing me. As I was walking back down the dock I spotted this particular cleat that was being used to tie up a small rowboat. I love the texture of the lines that wrap around it, as well as how they create a nice curving leading line that draws the eyes over to the boat.</p>
<figure class='vertical'>
  <img src='/images/p52/p52-46bs.jpg'>
</figure>
<p>I wanted to get the boat out by itself without the post seemingly coming out of the top, yet I still wanted the cleat in the foreground. To achieve this shot I collapsed my tripod down all the way and flipped the center post into a horizontal position, setting the camera up an inch or two above the wood planks of the dock, completely laying prone while shooting. It was only a few inches away from the cleat, so in live vew I temporarily set the exposure wide open to focus manually, locking on the cleat itself. Even at f/22 the background turned a little soft, which I think works here. After I had set the focus I backed the exposure down to eight seconds, and took some shots as the sun disappeared.</p>
<p>This is probably one of my favorite shots I have taken in a while, I can clearly see this either framed or as an oversize canvas wrap hanging on my wall.</p>

    <figure>

  <figcaption>Mystic River Bascule Bridge - 5 shot panorama</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I have always wanted to photograph one of my childhood favorites - the Mystic River bascule bridge - and since we are staying in Connecticut for the month I finally have the opportunity. My family owned a dry goods store on the corner here for years, so I have many childhood memories of being around downtown Mystic and specifically watching the bridge raise and lower once an hour - its quite a sight.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rick-sammons-photo-sundial/id689328812?mt=8">Rick Sammon's Photo Sundial app</a> I checked to see when the light would be ideal, and my hunch was correct - just after sunrise the bridge would be bathed in a warm yellow orange light. I forced myself out of bed at 5:45 am and drove downtown, walking around the boardwalk as the sun started creeping over the horizon. Finally around 7:15am the sun was high enough to paint the entire scene with a nice soft light. After playing around with panoramas in week 43 I decided to try it out correctly this time. I shot 5 frames hand-held vertically starting with the bridge to my right, then panning down river to the left. I was sure to overlap my images by about 30% to give Photoshop's photomerge feature enough room to work with while stitching together everything. I carefully aligned each shot to complete an almost 180&deg; shot, making sure to avoid any traffic over the bridge.</p>
<p>I touched up each photo before running the composite, if I didn't photoshop gets confused by the lens vingetting and averages them out to create some ugly dark spots in the sky. For panoramas I prefer to crop down to a 16x9 aspect ratio, it seems better than the custom ultra-wide and short ones artists sell, but more focused than a basic 4x3. I'm not 100% sold on the warping effect of the foreground dock, but overall I love the image and want to print and frame this right away. So much more of New England to get this month!</p>

    <h1><a href="/2014/10/28/photo52-week43/">Week 43 - Fall Panorama</a></h1>
    <figure>

  <figcaption>Three image stitched panorama</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This weeks photo was taken from a hiking trail overlooking Eagle Ridge Resort in Galena, IL. My company held a corporate retreat over the weekend, so I had to bring along my camera gear to capture some late fall colors.</p>
<p>The final image is comprised of three separate exposures. While I hauled some photo gear on our hike for portraits, I left the tripod in the car to save weight, not thinking I would do any panoramas (which I rarely shoot). Unfortunately this meant I had to hand hold the camera, while being extremely steady. With any panorama shot it is vital to keep the horizon level in each shot, while overlapping by 20-30% to ensure smooth stitching in post. Once the images are captured I use Adobe Bridge to Photomerge each image into one composite shot. </p>

<p>For the best results you should shoot more exposures vertically with a tripod, this gives you room in post to crop down without sacrificing vital portions of the image. You can see above the three images merged into one. In order to create the final image I had to crop out quite a bit from the top and bottom. I do like the final exposure, but it definitely loses a lot when viewed online unless you can zoom in all the way. Ideally this could be printed out to over 40" wide to capture all the detail.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2014/10/10/photo52-week41/">Week 41 - Off Camera Flash</a></h1>
    <figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/phottix-test.jpg">
  <figcaption>Off camera flash &amp; 24" softbox<span>1/160th, f/2.8, ISO1250</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Obviously I have been rather busy the past six weeks, although I would never complain about the work. The baby has been growing like crazy and things are going very well. While I never had any experience in photographing newborns before, I have been through baby-photo boot-camp and come out the other side a little bit more experienced in getting some fun photos of my little one.</p>
<p>With an infant its obvious that you don't want to be firing off a flash in their eyes, but you also want studio quality portraits right from day one, so what do you do? For her first few weeks I did natural light only, taking advantage of the sun shining through the windows when I could, but its difficult. Now that she is moving around a bit more I decided to try a bit of fill light using my new Phottix Ares wireless flash trigger. I mounted it with my Canon 430EX flash on a portable 24" softbox, setting the flash down to 1/64 power, and placing the light stand a few feet behind me while she laid on mommies tummy on the couch. I found shooting anything less than 1/160th was not going to work - she doesn't move a lot, but when she turns or bobs her head it's quicker than you'd expect. ISO was set around 1250, while my 50mm was opened up to f/2.8.</p>
<p>The softbox diffused the light so well Alison didn't bat an eye. Positioning a one-month old is a challenge to say the least - additionally I am super sensitive to make sure I don't upset her, so we pretty much let her do her own thing. She's not sitting up on her own, and propping her up for photos can easily turn a baby cranky very fast - we don't like going that route. Tummy time on a big blanket over mommy makes for a calm baby. While making some funny sounds she lifted her head and looked straight down the lens to make this my favorite photo of the session. When she gets older we can do some more posed shots, and in more of a studio setup, but its still fun to get some while playing around in the living room.</p>

    <figure>

  <figcaption>Phottix Ares Wireless Transmitter</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So a year or two ago I started playing around with off-camera flash, and knowing I couldn't afford a set of Pocket Wizards I went down to a local camera store and picked up a cheap wireless transmitter/receiver combo for around $35. I was disappointed to say the least - I won't name the product, but it was one of those cheap knock-off brands that are exclusive to brick-and-mortar stores. The stupid thing was really cheaply built and would randomly pop the flash, only firing when I hit the shutter maybe 25% of the time. I chucked the thing in my bag and forgot about it.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to get a good wireless trigger set, but very hesitant after my previous experience. I researched every now and then, but nothing jumped out at me - until I recently found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A4BR7KG">Phottix Ares Wireless Trigger</a>. Amazon had plenty of great reviews, so I decided to pick up a set. They arrived at my office yesterday.</p>
<p>I immediately noticed how well constructed they are. It comes with a transmitter that mounts to your camera's hot-shoe mount, and a receiver that you mount your flash or studio flash to. Both pieces take two AA batteries, and come with an 8 Channel 2.4GHz selector &amp; on/off switch. The transmitter can focus on one channel or all channels simultaneously if you are shooting with multiple receivers on different channels. It also came with cables to hook up to non-hot-shoe flash units as well as studio flashes.</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>Phottix Ares Wireless Receiver with Canon 430EX Flash</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I was extremely nervous as I got everything setup, remembering how bad the other set was. I powered both units on, and set them to Channel 1, mounted my Canon 430EX flash, and fired off a test shot. It worked flawlessly. I fired off another 10-20 shots, the flash going off every time. The units synced up to 1/200th, I am not sure if there is any high-speed syncing available. Range was great all around my office, from inches away to at least 20 feet. Not sure what the maximum range is, but once I get outside with the flash on a light-stand I'll see how they perform in the wild. I am really excited to use these for an actual shoot soon, I am fairly confident that they will work great.</p>
