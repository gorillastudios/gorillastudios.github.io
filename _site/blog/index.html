</figure>
<p>No matter what I do I can't stop taking photos of the Sears Tower, I've probably surpassed the thousand mark a while ago.
It doesn't help that I work just a few blocks from it, and on some days I like to go for a walk during lunch with my camera.
I've said before that I love taking photos of it because you can get dramatically different shots from all angles of the
building. I wanted to see if I had enough reach at 200mm to see people in the skyboxes that jut out from the west side of
the tower over Wacker Drive. This particular angle was from the north west corner on the pedestrian island out front. I
particularly like that you can't instantly figure out what you are looking at, and its certainly not a photo of the Sears I
have seen before. There is a very subtle lens flare from the afternoon sun taking up the right side of the exposure, but I
feel it adds a bit of warmth and character.</p>

<p>I already wrote a long post about my 4th of July weekend, so I want to keep this one brief. I selected another shot
from our family fireworks display in Indiana as my photo of the week. This is very close to what I had in mind when I
setup my tripod - I wanted a wide shot with the fireworks going off from in back of the house with a few people in frame
if possible. On my full-frame 5D MkIII at 19mm I was just shy of capturing the entire ark, but I love the overall exposure.
Great evening with the family.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2014/07/05/4th-of-July/">Fourth Of July</a></h1>
    <p>Another great 4th of July is now in the books. My wife and I were again lucky enough to watch the Chicago fireworks over Navy Pier from a high rise on Lake Shore Drive. It's a large building of condominiums with a private deck on the 35th floor - a perfect place to watch the show. I took a few exposures during magic hour to get everything set, that way all I had to worry about was exposure time. I found ISO 100 was too low, so I quickly bumped it to 400 at f/10, shooting bursts between 5 and 10 seconds. This was very early in the show, because the smoke quickly got overwhelming and headed straight towards us.</p>

<p>After the Navy Pier fireworks were over we were treated to an amazing view out west - we got to see all the west side and suburban fireworks, dozens of them all going off at once, from horizon to horizon. I can only imagine what the view would have been like from an airplane or helicopter. </p>

<p>The next day we drove down to Indiana for a relaxing weekend with the family. After a day at the beach and lots of grilled food, we pulled out the fireworks for a personal show in the back yard. It was tricky as I wasn't sure exactly where they would go off, or how long they would go for, so I was again in Bulb mode, essentially guessing my exposures each time. A few rain drops on the lens added some fun distortion to some of the photos, and I think this was my favorite.</p>

<p>After the large ones were shot off it was time for some roman candles and a little fun for the kids. Here is a prime example of almost exactly what I had in my mind working out as planned...with a lot of hard work. When I saw the first one lit I knew I wanted one of the kids faces light up by the firework from coming out of their hand, problem was it was almost pitch black so I had to manually focus while they were lighting the first few off. Once I locked in focus I had to time a 1/30th second shot right after the sparks shot out and briefly light the scene. It took quite a few attempts but I finally captured this.</p>

<p>I absolutely love this photo, but the feeling of showing her parents that shot was even better. That's what I love about candid portraiture, capturing that special moment that takes someones breath away when they see it. We had quite a few moments like that this weekend, but this one still makes me smile every time I see it. Happy 4th of July everyone.</p>

  <figcaption>June 29th - Adult Bald Eagle<span>1/320, f/4.5, ISO100</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Taking a break from cityscapes and architecture, this week I packed up my gear and headed back out into nature. A friend and I
went out for a morning shoot around the Fox River with no particular goal in mind, however we chanced upon two fisherman who told
us that some bald eagles had nested north of us in Mooseheart, where the juveniles were getting ready to fly for the first time.</p>

<p>Arriving at the location it was obvious where the nest was. Bald eagles have the largest nest size of any bird in North America,
or possibly anywhere period. I estimate it was probably a good 8-10 feet around, and equally as deep. The juvenile bald eagle is a
very dark brown with a few white feathers poking out at various spots on their body. Their heads are not white, nor are their beaks
yellow until adulthood, which is at about 5 years old or so. It was very difficult to get any clean photos of the juveniles since
the pine tree was fairly thick.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of watching them we noticed an adult in an adjacent tree staring at us very closely. There is very little
difference between the male and females, the only distinct difference being size - the females tend to be about 25% larger than the
males. Judging by the size I presume this was the father. He hopped around a little bit when we spotted him presumably to watch us
closer, but didn't move apart from that. I took this with a 70-200mm 2.8, and this is a 100% crop which tells you how high up he was.
I shouldn't be surprised, but I was taken aback at how good their eyesight was. On exposure after exposure you could plainly see they
were watching us extremely closely - constantly looking right down the barrel of the lens. These are truly majestic creatures and I
hope to get a chance to photograph them flying and feeding at the river.</p>
