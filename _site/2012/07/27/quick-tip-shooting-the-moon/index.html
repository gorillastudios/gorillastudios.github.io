<h3><span class="icon Astro-PhotographyQuick-Tip"></span> Quick Tip - Shooting The Moon</h3>
  <p><img class="img_center" src="/images/half_moon.jpg" alt="Half Moon shot on July 27th, 2012 with a Canon EOS 10D + Quantaray 600-1000mm" /></p>

<p>Here are two things you can do to give your astro and night photography a little boost.  First is to pair your cable release with the camera's 'Mirror Lock' function. Simply go into your DSLR's custom functions and select Mirror Lock. By enabling this, when you press the shutter release the mirror swings up and out of the way locking into position and holding in place. You then have to press the button again to open the shutter and make the exposure. After the photo is taken the mirror swings back into place as normal. What this does is eliminate any shaking or movement involved when the mirror flips up.  Normally during the day time and during normal photos this movement does not matter, but when you are trying to keep the camera as steady as possible during a long exposure at night it makes a large difference.</p>

<p>Second is to use a UV/Haze filter. These filters cut down on UV light and haze that can impact image quality. Sometimes the difference isn't that great, but when I shot a before and after tonight I was impressed with what a cheap $20 UV filter did.  The moon was low in the sky when the shot was taken, increasing the amount of atmospheric haze to shoot through.  Both images were taken within a minute of each other, on my Canon 10D paired with a Quantaray 600-1000mm super telephoto, extended to 1000mm, <i>f</i>/16 at 1/30th of a second, ISO 100. On the left the mirror was not locked and the filter was not on the lens. On the right the mirror-lock function is enabled and the filter is on. Without the mirror-lock the first image was shaken enough to impact the sharpness, and you can also see the clarity difference as well.</p>
