        <title>Week 43 - Fall Panorama</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/panorama.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Three image stitched panorama&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weeks photo was taken from a hiking trail overlooking Eagle Ridge Resort in Galena, IL. My company held a corporate retreat over the weekend, so I had to bring along my camera gear to capture some late fall colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final image is comprised of three separate exposures. While I hauled some photo gear on our hike for portraits, I left the tripod in the car to save weight, not thinking I would do any panoramas (which I rarely shoot). Unfortunately this meant I had to hand hold the camera, while being extremely steady. With any panorama shot it is vital to keep the horizon level in each shot, while overlapping by 20-30% to ensure smooth stitching in post. Once the images are captured I use Adobe Bridge to Photomerge each image into one composite shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/photomerge.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/original-panorama.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Un-cropped panorama&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the best results you should shoot more exposures vertically with a tripod, this gives you room in post to crop down without sacrificing vital portions of the image. You can see above the three images merged into one. In order to create the final image I had to crop out quite a bit from the top and bottom. I do like the final exposure, but it definitely loses a lot when viewed online unless you can zoom in all the way. Ideally this could be printed out to over 40&quot; wide to capture all the detail.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 41 - Off Camera Flash</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/phottix-test.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Off camera flash &amp;amp; 24&quot; softbox&lt;span&gt;1/160th, f/2.8, ISO1250&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I have been rather busy the past six weeks, although I would never complain about the work. The baby has been growing like crazy and things are going very well. While I never had any experience in photographing newborns before, I have been through baby-photo boot-camp and come out the other side a little bit more experienced in getting some fun photos of my little one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an infant its obvious that you don&#39;t want to be firing off a flash in their eyes, but you also want studio quality portraits right from day one, so what do you do? For her first few weeks I did natural light only, taking advantage of the sun shining through the windows when I could, but its difficult. Now that she is moving around a bit more I decided to try a bit of fill light using my new Phottix Ares wireless flash trigger. I mounted it with my Canon 430EX flash on a portable 24&quot; softbox, setting the flash down to 1/64 power, and placing the light stand a few feet behind me while she laid on mommies tummy on the couch. I found shooting anything less than 1/160th was not going to work - she doesn&#39;t move a lot, but when she turns or bobs her head it&#39;s quicker than you&#39;d expect. ISO was set around 1250, while my 50mm was opened up to f/2.8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The softbox diffused the light so well Alison didn&#39;t bat an eye. Positioning a one-month old is a challenge to say the least - additionally I am super sensitive to make sure I don&#39;t upset her, so we pretty much let her do her own thing. She&#39;s not sitting up on her own, and propping her up for photos can easily turn a baby cranky very fast - we don&#39;t like going that route. Tummy time on a big blanket over mommy makes for a calm baby. While making some funny sounds she lifted her head and looked straight down the lens to make this my favorite photo of the session. When she gets older we can do some more posed shots, and in more of a studio setup, but its still fun to get some while playing around in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Phottix Ares Trigger</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/phottix1.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Phottix Ares Wireless Transmitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a year or two ago I started playing around with off-camera flash, and knowing I couldn&#39;t afford a set of Pocket Wizards I went down to a local camera store and picked up a cheap wireless transmitter/receiver combo for around $35. I was disappointed to say the least - I won&#39;t name the product, but it was one of those cheap knock-off brands that are exclusive to brick-and-mortar stores. The stupid thing was really cheaply built and would randomly pop the flash, only firing when I hit the shutter maybe 25% of the time. I chucked the thing in my bag and forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to get a good wireless trigger set, but very hesitant after my previous experience. I researched every now and then, but nothing jumped out at me - until I recently found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A4BR7KG&quot;&gt;Phottix Ares Wireless Trigger&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon had plenty of great reviews, so I decided to pick up a set. They arrived at my office yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately noticed how well constructed they are. It comes with a transmitter that mounts to your camera&#39;s hot-shoe mount, and a receiver that you mount your flash or studio flash to. Both pieces take two AA batteries, and come with an 8 Channel 2.4GHz selector &amp;amp; on/off switch. The transmitter can focus on one channel or all channels simultaneously if you are shooting with multiple receivers on different channels. It also came with cables to hook up to non-hot-shoe flash units as well as studio flashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/phottix2.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Phottix Ares Wireless Receiver with Canon 430EX Flash&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was extremely nervous as I got everything setup, remembering how bad the other set was. I powered both units on, and set them to Channel 1, mounted my Canon 430EX flash, and fired off a test shot. It worked flawlessly. I fired off another 10-20 shots, the flash going off every time. The units synced up to 1/200th, I am not sure if there is any high-speed syncing available. Range was great all around my office, from inches away to at least 20 feet. Not sure what the maximum range is, but once I get outside with the flash on a light-stand I&#39;ll see how they perform in the wild. I am really excited to use these for an actual shoot soon, I am fairly confident that they will work great.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Alison Noel&lt;span&gt;1/50th, f/2.8, ISO1600&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was rather hectic, and now I am proud to post why: I am proud to
introduce Alison Noel. My wife and I welcomed her into the world August 30th at 11:05am.
After an amazing week she is starting to open her eyes and explore the world around
her. I had her laying on her back on my legs while I played with a 50mm macro
lens. She looked straight down the barrel and I snapped her first official
portrait.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 34 - Bret Michaels</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/bm/4.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Bret Michaels Band - &lt;i&gt;CD &amp;amp; Me August 22nd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;1/250th, f/2.8, ISO3200&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week proved that you can&#39;t give up and hard work eventually pays off. I have been
reaching out to bands, venues, and promoters trying to get into a larger concert for quite
some time now and I finally got in touch with a stage manager who hooked me up with my first
official press pass to see The Bret Michaels Band in Frankfort, IL on Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a medium sized outdoor festival, and to my dismay there was no photo pit. Bret
had sold out the first two rows as part of a meet-and-greet package, and the seats were right
up against the stage - I knew getting in close was going to be a challenge. I used a Canon
70-200mm 2.8 so I knew I had some reach, and combined with my height it wasn&#39;t a major issue.
I was able to visualize my shots with a few practice shots of the first opener, and then dial in
my exposure settings during Driven Under&#39;s set. The main problem of the evening turned out to be
the red LED lights that were blowing everything out when they turned on, which compromised more than
a few shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before Bret went on management told me I had a three song limit and then I had to
leave, which is fairly common for big acts so I wasn&#39;t shocked. The three songs went by in a blur,
but I was able stay cool and get the shots I wanted. I was on the left side of the stage for the first song
but quickly realized that since Bret is right handed, his hand and mic were covering up most of his
face. When the song ended I quickly darted behind stage and back out to the left side, getting much
better shots. It was a lot of fun to shoot a really professional act, and I think I got some great
pieces for my portfolio. Check out the rest of the shots &lt;a href=&#39;/bret-michaels&#39;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 33 - Kodiak</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/kodiak/7.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Kodiak&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I went out with Kodiak, a local folk trio who just love playing
music. They asked to go out and get a few promo shots, as well as some fun
candids of them playing. We walked down to Montrose Beach on Lake Michigan and
they just started playing while I was getting set up. We shot around various locations
as the sun set, so I had to use a Speedlite on a remote trigger as fill light.
I shot with a 70-200mm 2.8 which is kind of an odd choice for group portraits,
but I like using it because I can stand rather far back and let them feel a bit
more natural, its nice not shoving a camera in their faces while they are just
trying to play. Additionally shooting at 3.5 or 4 really compresses and blows
out the background, putting all the focus on the band. It was a ton of fun and
I cant wait to be able to shoot them in concert soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NMOS14 - Chicago</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night a rally was held at Daley Plaza here in Chicago to show solidarity with
the people of Ferguson, MO. The demonstration centered around a moment of silence at 6:20pm.
Here are some of my photographs presented without comment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 32 - Porsche Speedster</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/p52/32.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Porsche Speedster&lt;span&gt;1/100, f/2.8, ISO400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week my father and I finally got around to pulling his Porsche Speedster
replica out of the back of the garage, blowing off the dust and firing it up. We
spent the afternoon tinkering around with it and getting it back into running shape
after it sitting since last summer. As a surprise I wanted to take some glamor shots
of it to make a calendar or some framed prints for him, so I dug up my studio lights
and got to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to go for more of a dramatic look where the background fades to black
because I expected to convert most shots to high-contrast black and white, so my key light
was a simple speedlight in a softbox on a light stand. The garage was only light by
a single light bulb on the ceiling, and the lightbox here was right against the passenger
rear tire shooting down into the cab. The steering wheel and gauge cluster look absolutely
fantastic so I grabbed my 50mm macro and shot at f/2.8 to make some really beautiful closeups.
I spent an hour or so shooting the interior, and once we get the car completely cleaned up I
would like to try some full body exterior shots.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rolliflex Kit</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/rolliflex.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Recesky 35mm TLR Camera Kit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always wanted an original &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolleiflex&quot;&gt;Rolliflex Twin Lens Reflex camera&lt;/a&gt; but could never pull the trigger due to the cost
of one in good condition. I was poking around Amazon a few weeks ago and found some replica kits for only $25, so I
added it to my wish-list. Lo and behold one arrived at my door a few days after my birthday! The kit comes completely
disassembled, with a screwdriver and a single roll of 35mm ISO200 film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/rolliflex-assembly.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Assembly&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening it up I was rather surprised &lt;i&gt;how much&lt;/i&gt; assembly was required. Everything down to the shutter was
in pieces, and unfortunately the instructions were obviously translated into English, meaning they were about as
clear as mud. Thankfully I know my way around a film camera so everything was fairly easy to figure out, the biggest
problem was that two of the shutter springs were mis-labelled. Once I figured that out assembly wasn&#39;t too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality is exactly what you would expect from a $25 dollar kit. Everything is plastic and on the flimsier side,
but as completed kit it holds up okay. I will load it up with film and pick something to shoot in the next few days.
Stay tuned for the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the kit at Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004PALJBA/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 31 - Meadow Saxifrage</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/p52/31.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Meadow Saxifrage&lt;span&gt;1/125, f/2.8, ISO50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I wanted to mix it up a little bit and try practicing macro work again.
Years ago I bought a Quantaray 50mm macro, and from time to time I like to photograph
flowers and bugs up close. My parents work very hard on their gardens so the backyard
is an absolute playground for someone who wants to do flower-scapes. I grabbed
my gear and headed out to the backyard Sunday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shooting at 50mm for subjects like this means getting the lens less than an inch or two
from the subject quite often, which means you block out a lot of natural light. To compensate
for this I used my flash off camera on a long cable. This allows me to use the flash hand-held,
giving me the flexibility to orientate it any way I needed. I kept the camera on my Manfrotto
tripod with the center column locked perpendicular to the legs, swinging the camera out over
the flowers instead of trying to make it work as a traditional tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with some yellow daisies, but nothing was quite grabbing me. I wanted to get in
extremely close and hopefully wind up with a photo that could be printed and framed. I made
my way around the garden, eventually setting up directly above a large pot full of what I believe
are Meadow Saxifrage. They couldn&#39;t have been more than an inch across, so it was going to be
difficult to say the least. I struggled trying not to blow out the petals with the flash while
getting the exposure of the stamen correct, finally settling on 1/125th at 2.8, with the flash
stopped down to 1/32nd power with a puffer defuser, held just to the right of the lens. At 2.8
this close the depth of field was incredibly shallow - the stamen are sharp, as well as the edge
of the right most petal, with a little bit of details on each petal at the center. Two stems
directly underneath add just the right touch to break up what would have been a dull background.&lt;/p&gt;
