        <title>Loupedeck+ First Impressions</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/loupedeck-box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Loupedeck+ Box&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had my eye on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://loupedeck.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Loupedeck&lt;/a&gt; console for quite some time so last week I finally pulled the trigger and ordered their new + version. It was originally a Kickstarter project designed for editing photos in Lightroom using dedicated physical buttons, dials, and sliders. Recently Loupedeck released an updated version called the Loupedeck+. The console works with Lightroom Classic CC, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Highlights.aspx&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Capture One Pro&lt;/a&gt; (which I have been meaning to check out), and another program called &lt;a href=&quot;https://skylum.com/aurorahdr&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Aurora HDR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It arrived in a few days and I was immediately impressed with the packaging. The box was nicely designed and the console itself was wrapped in a sturdy foam enclosure making sure it could survive any bumps and drops during shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a nice weight to it, but it's not too heavy. The knobs and dials are all crisp and feel great while spinning. It's just about as wide as my 15&quot; Macbook Pro and has a very low profile so when I set it in front I can quickly reach over it to use my trackpad or keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/loupedeck-in-box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Loupedeck+ interior packaging&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Installation and setup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructions were very adamant that you install the software before plugging in the console so I downloaded and installed it with no issues. The Loupedeck+ connects over and is powered by a standard USB connector. I plugged it in, fired up Lightroom, and was delighted by a brief message saying &quot;Loupedeck thinks you look lovely&quot;. Unfortunately that feeling didn't last long as I started spinning knobs but nothing happened. I tried unplugging and plugging it in, restarting the Loupedeck application, restarting Lightroom, even tried a different USB-C adapter, no luck. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of troubleshooting I eventually found out I was running Lightroom CC Classic (2015), &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; Lightroom Classic CC. Once I updated Lightroom everything worked perfectly. Crisis avoided. One side note: apparently it doesn't support the new cloud-based Creative Cloud (don't get me started on Adobe's naming conventions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/loupedeck-instructions.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Loupedeck+ instructions&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of reviews online complain about the build quality. I've spent about a week with it and I can tell you the build quality is great for the most part. My one concern is the large control dial - it wobbles a bit more than I would prefer, but I think it should hold up okay. Looking at the dates of said reviews I think the majority of them were about the first version, where as I have the second revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other significant question online was does this make your editing process faster? While I've only used it a handful of time so far I can tell you for sure, yes it does. Not having to hunt for specific panels and sliders in the sidebar is a blessing. Instead of shifting my focus back and forth between the photo to the sidebar I can see the photo full screen and use the Loupedeck while my eyes stay where they need to be. I'm starting to get a feel for where each control knob is and I'm sure I will get faster the more muscle memory I build up. All the controls have a great amount of sensitivity, so making subtle changes to things like color temperature are easy without swinging too far one way or the other. So far the only control that I can't use the console for is adjusting my tone curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One neat thing about the knobs and dials is that you can press down on them and it will reset that adjustment back to the default setting. Very handy, and a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/loupedeck-settings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Loupedeck+ control panel&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dedicated controls for your HSL levels, exposure, contrast, clarity, shadows, highlights, blacks, whites, vibrance, color temperature, and tint. Additionally, there are also buttons for things like viewing a before &amp;amp; after, color labels and star ratings, black &amp;amp; white development, and more. On top of all that, there are 17 programmable buttons you can customize to fit your workflow. I haven't learned about the Custom Mode toggle yet, but I assume that's even more customization. In the control panel you can click on any of the custom function controls and map it to just about any function in Lightroom (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/loupedeck-custom-settings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Loupedeck+ control panel custom settings&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I am really happy with the purchase. The build quality is great, and after using it to edit a handful of photos I really like using it. I'll share my thoughts in a few months after I get more comfortable using this in my workflow, but right now I am very optimistic that it's going to become a valuable addition to my process. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chasing a bullet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For as long as I can remember I've always been fascinated by everything to do with space. Recently, I tore through Mike Massimino's book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Spaceman-Astronauts-Unlikely-Journey-Universe-ebook/dp/B01A4B1SK0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1527892448&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mike+massimino&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spaceman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and now am reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Interstellar-Age-Forty-Year-Voyager-Mission-ebook/dp/B00L9AXW4G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1527892488&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=interstellar+age&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Interstellar Age&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is about NASA's Voyager 1 &amp;amp; 2 missions. My daughter delights in watching Commander Chris Hadfield's videos from the International Space Station so much that we've seen every one many many times, and I've watched both series of Cosmos multiple times. Since I am a certified Space Geek, it's only natural that I try to combine that with my passion for photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest photos I have ever seen is of the Space Shuttle docking with International Space Station while in transit past the sun, but I always wondered how on earth did they do that? Could I do that? The station itself is orbiting the earth 250 miles up moving at 17,500mph, which makes photographing it like chasing a bullet. The first hurdle was to find a tool to tell me where and when it would be. After some searching I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.transit-finder.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Transit Finder&lt;/a&gt; which when given lat/long and date range would tell me exactly where and when I needed to be down to the millisecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/iss-transit/options.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Transit Finder results&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Results listing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, options are limited if you don't want to travel a few hours to make an attempt. I checked the site weekly for at least a year, but most opportunities slipped by due to scheduling conflicts or just poor weather. I finally made my first attempt a month ago on May 1st at sunrise. I rolled out of bed at 4:30 and drove 45 minutes south to see if I could capture the ISS just before moonset set. To track the path of the ISS I used an iPhone app called SkyView Lite, and everything looked perfect. I was ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/iss-transit/IMG_8517.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SkyView Lite&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Looking good&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked my phone a few more times, and when I got about two minutes out I just sat there, staring through the camera's eye piece watching as hard as I could. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Nothing. Checked the app again and the ISS had blown right past - I had no idea if it was close, I never even spotted it. I was disappointed, but determined to figure out what happened. When I got home I realized that at the time the ISS was illuminated and would have appeared as a white spot reflecting sunlight, while I was looking for the distinct black silhouette. Okay, rookie mistake. I made a note and went back to checking Transit Finder every few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally two weeks ago I saw a favorable opportunity where I could get to the center line only having to travel about 25 minutes from home, and 12:06pm was reasonable. I plotted out three backup sites just incase of unforeseen impediments. The spot I chose was a back road off the beaten path where I could setup and hopefully not be bothered. I had the time, I had the place, now the only x-factor was the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/iss-transit/gilberts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plotting my spot&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Plotting the best spot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night I packed up my gear and despite some intermittent clouds, headed out. I found the location easily enough thanks to scouring Google Maps a few times a day during the past week. Checking SkyView Lite I was a bit confused - the ISS was tracking to rise in the West just a few minutes before it was due to cross the Moon in the South East. I still setup my gear but kept an eye on the station wondering if the app was wrong. I knew it travelled fast but didn't realize it would shoot horizon to horizon in a matter of minutes. By the time I got the telescope setup and tracking the Moon I checked SkyView again and saw the ISS was already directly at the zenith and headed to intersect the Moon at an alarming pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like my first attempt I had my eye glued to the eyepiece for a few minutes, concentrating on where the station should begin it's transit. I glanced up once or twice to see if I could catch it with my naked eye, but no luck. Finally I spotted it coming out from between the Sea of Serenity and the Sea of Tranquility, and mashed the remote cable release. I successfully got nine frames of the ISS transiting the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/iss-transit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ISS Lunar Transit&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;ISS Lunar Transit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked the image previews as fast as I coulld and let out a yell. I had gotten it! It's angular size was 27.46&quot; so it was much smaller than ideal, but you could still see the distinct shape cutting across the lunar surface. After importing the images and doing some minor tweaks, I stacked them in Photoshop and set the blending mode to stack each frame together, creating the final composite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at other opportunities in Transit Finder I realize that the stations angular size can vary from the low 20s all the way into the 60s, meaning it would appear two to three times bigger in ideal conditions. I'm going to keep trying for some better results and will probably try a solar transit at some point. Anyway, as Neil deGrasse Tyson always says, keep looking up!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>52 Book Challenge - Exhibitions &amp;amp; Adams</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/week-2-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This weeks books are Exhibiting Photography and Ansel Adams: Divine Performance&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm keeping up with my reading challenge, but was side tracked by getting the flu which knocked me out for almost a week. During the down time I was able to tear through two books. First up was in preparation for my upcoming show at the local library called &lt;i&gt;Exhibiting Photography - a practical guide to displaying your work&lt;/i&gt; by Shirley Read. The second was &lt;i&gt;Ansel Adams - Divine Performance&lt;/i&gt; by Anne Hammond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exhibiting Photography&lt;/i&gt; is a dense book covering a variety of methods for displaying your work in public which I found very helpful. In the book there are a number of case studies walking through real world projects, covering the process from start to finish. I'll definitely be re-checking this one out as my exhibition comes closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am primarily a landscape photographer, so of course I was going to get a book on Ansel Adams. I was surprised by this one though, most books I've thumbed through are mostly just portfolio studies, where as &lt;i&gt;Divine Performance&lt;/i&gt; takes a large portion of the book talking about his life. I wasn't aware that he was an extremely talented musician as well as the grandfather of landscape photography. While it's a great read, it's not a book I'm going to put on my shelf as a part of my permanent collection - I would much prefer one of his portfolio studies that I can pick up and just soak in his photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>52 Book Challenge - Soul of the Camera</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/soul-of-the-camera.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Soul of the Camera, written by David duChemin&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not being a fan of New Years resolutions, I have always enjoyed a good long-term photography challenge. I've done a Photo 365, a Photo 52, and a number of other challenges throughout the years. For the 2018 calendar year I want to invest in my knowledge surrounding the &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt; of photography. I feel as though I am finally finding my personal style and want to learn more about telling a story, creating a cohesive body of work, and how to become a better critic of both my own art and others. To achieve this I am going to challenge myself to read 52 photography books this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week I voraciously read &lt;i&gt;The Soul of the Camera&lt;/i&gt; by a true inspiration of mine, David duChemin. David is the force behind the amazing website and occasionally weekly podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://craftandvision.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; alt=&quot;Craft and Vision website, by David duChemin&quot;&gt;Craft &amp;amp; Vision&lt;/a&gt;. His weekly lectures are amazing and keep getting better, so needless to say I was excited when I found this book underneath the Christmas tree this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David's catchphrase is &lt;i&gt;&quot;Gear is good, but vision is better&quot;&lt;/i&gt;, and this book is a complete embodiment of that concept broken into twenty-four essays. Topics range from discovering your vision and intent, capturing the best moment, ignoring perfection, and how to critique work. What you &lt;i&gt;won't&lt;/i&gt; find in the book is deep discussions about the technical side of photography which I find absolutely refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of photographers, especially those just getting into the practice who are obsessed with gear. The first question they ask me is &quot;what camera do you use?&quot;  or &quot;what aperture and shutter speed were used here?&quot; instead of asking more insightful questions about the actual content of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You've got to know how to use the pen and use it well, but when you're writing your poem or your story, it won't be the pen to which your mind goes. And it won't be your pen that resonates with readers; it will be you and your story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this quote, and he uses this metaphor a number of times. When I read a great book I could care less what typewriter or computer was used, I care about the characters &amp;amp; story. The same goes for a photo that catches my eye - I don't care what camera or settings were used, I try to breakdown &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; it grabbed me, what the artist was trying to say, and what I might do differently. Sure some technical questions might pop up in my head, but those are way down on the list, and not very important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that this book should be issued to every Photo 101 student on day one. It's an amazing collection of writing and deserves to be on every photographers bookshelf. Hardcovers and Kindle copies are available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Soul-Camera-Photographers-Place-Picture-Making/dp/1681982021/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1515421426&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=soul+of+the+camera&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and you can find the rest of David's books on &lt;a href=&quot;https://craftandvision.com/&quot; target=&quot;blanK&quot;&gt;Craft &amp;amp; Vision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My top 10 images of 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another year has come and gone which means again it's time to look back and choose my best shots from the 2017 calendar year. I've done this exercise for the past few years and find it to be a wonderful learning experience as well as extremely rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find my best work I have a smart gallery in Lightroom to display any 3 star or higher images taken this calendar year. At the end of the year I start weeding out weaker shots, taking a few passes to get the collection down to the top 15 or so. This year I started with a set of 48 images, which seems about average for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2017-finalists.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Photos in 2016 rated 3+&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I get closer to the final 10 things start to get tricky. Editing photos, in the context of creating a body of work, not actually adjusting exposure, colors, etc.., means making some hard decisions about what to include and what to leave out. Time usually makes this easier - photos you were in love with right after they were taken don't seem as exciting, and sometimes others that might not have grabbed your attention stand out now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much deliberation I finally narrowed it down to my top 10 from the 2017 calendar year. They are presented in chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day job is in the Chicago Loop, which gives me some great opportunities to do architecture photography. Whenever I am walking to and from the train station I keep my eyes open, some days taking detours and alternate routes for fun. During one of these walks a building I walk by daily finally caught my eye. At street level it's just another white office building completely over-shadowed by the Sears Tower across the street. However at the top there is an angled cutaway that allows for some interesting photographs when taken from Adams Street. I took this at 200mm when the sky was flat and slightly overcast. I love this particular perspective, the simplicity of the angles make it look almost like a pyramid, plus the weathering on the corner of the building breaks up the straight lines a bit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A4769.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;200 S. Wacker&lt;/i&gt; - Chicago&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I started creating a series of photographs taken at 16mm straight up of the skyscrapers around the Loop. It is difficult not to have power lines, light poles, or other distractions in frame but the challenge is fun. I had primarily stayed close to Wacker Drive around Monroe but one afternoon I wandered down to Dearborn &amp;amp; Madison where I found a small alley across from the Chase building. Looking up I realized I had stumbled onto something with a lot of potential - another location that you might walk by hundreds of times without noticing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A5290.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steel Giants IV&lt;/i&gt; - Chicago&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason I find it rather difficult getting these shots, because when I lean back and point the camera straight up I start losing my balance. I have to plant my legs wide open and make sure I'm not too close to traffic, I don't want to keel over into the street. Despite the difficulties I love the perspective a super-wide angle gets pointing straight up, watching the buildings almost disappear into the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late July we packed up and we headed out to Connecticut for a much needed break while visiting family. Spending a week in Mystic and the surrounding areas is a great way for me to recharge my batteries and try my hand photographing subjects I simply don't have the opportunity to capture in Illinois. One of my all time favorite photographers is &lt;a href=&quot;http://vanderwal.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Onne Van Der Wal&lt;/a&gt; who has an amazing gallery in Newport Rhode Island, and he shoots boats and other nautical subjects. I always think of him when I'm out on the water with my camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first morning there I headed down to Mason's Island before sunrise only to find everything completely fogged over. Disappointed for about ten seconds, I headed down the dock to see various sail boats just peacefully tied up in the water, almost looking like ghost ships where my disappointment vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A7609.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Foggy morning, Mason's Island Connecticut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat down and just listened to the fog horns while water lapped at the dock - almost a zen like experience for me. Bouncing between a 50mm prime and the 70-200mm I tried some different perspectives all while making sure I didn't go off the edge of the dock and in for a drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still wanting a nice colorful sunrise I headed down the next morning when I saw the skies were crystal clear. What a difference 24 hours makes - this next frame is the exact same set of boats from almost the same spot just as the sun was breaking over the trees of Dodge's Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A7923.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sunrise at Mason's Island Connecticut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small rowboat tied to the dock caught my eye, it's white paint and lines against the almost black water made for some wonderful contrast, and the wood was the perfect splash of color. I leaned way out over the water and shot this almost straight down, making sure my feet were planted and my camera strap was secure. Even after six months this stands out as one of my all time favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A8007.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Possibility&lt;/i&gt; - Mystic Connecticut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my last day I headed down again to see if I could pick up any more shots, and as I walked all the way down the dock I noticed that the horizon was fading perfectly into the sky. If I was more of a sailor I could tell you what kind of boat that is, but it's been years since I have been out on the water. Regardless I love the simplicity of the near silhouette of the boat, the seagulls flying by, and the cool colors just starting to warm up in the morning sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A7849.jpg&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August I headed over to Italian Fest in Lisle to shoot &lt;a href=&quot;http://everettdean.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Everett Dean&lt;/a&gt; who always puts on a great show. While I was over on the side stage behind a huge stack of PAs I saw him rear into his Chucky Berry shuffle when I got this shot - really capturing the energy of his performance from a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Everett Dean&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The September eclipse had been circled on my calendar for a few years, so to say I was excited was a bit of an understatement. I packed all my gear including the tracking mount for my telescope and headed down to Fulton, Missouri which was right on the path of totality. The day was intensely hot and clouds were threatening us all morning but everything stayed clear during the partial phases and most importantly during totality. This shot is a composite of 9 exposures to capture the detail of the corona radiating outwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Eclipse totality&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It truly was an amazing experience that I still can't quite describe, but for a full look at the rest of the day, you can read &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2017/08/12/solar-eclipse.html&quot; target=&quot;blanK&quot;&gt;my post about the Eclipse here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November had me flying out to Los Angeles for the third year in a row, so I decided to take a break and head over to Venice Beach and watch the sunset over the pier. This was another situation that I was able to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://photoephemeris.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;The Photographer's Ephemeris&lt;/a&gt; to plot out exactly where I needed to be and when to catch the sun directly behind the pier. I recommend keeping those eclipse glasses handy because it makes shooting directly at the sun much more comfortable lining up the shot if you have to make small adjustments. Looking directly at the sun at anytime can damage your eyes, not just during the  eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running up and down the beach a bit trying different angles I took this shot as I was knee deep in the surf dodging waves again. Knowing I only had about twenty minutes of sun I went from 16mm wide open all the way through to 200mm covering a lot of perspectives, but I think this frame at 35mm was my favorite. I like the waves crashing in as the sun started peeking out from below the pier deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final shot was taken towards the end of September when I woke up extra early to take the train into the city, catching the sun as it rose behind Cloud Gate in Millennium Park. All the other photographers there that early were shooting form the other side to catch the warm sun on the buildings, but I knew I had a good chance of a sunburst coming from underneath the sculpture on this side. I was flat on my stomach shooting inches off the ground at 16mm wide open to capture this frame. Hoping to get some motion in the clouds I had stopped down to f/16 and opened the shutter for a second or two, and while I didn't get the clouds moving, a runner stopped to stretch and look around a bit, adding a nice sense of scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A1996.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Cloud Gate at sunrise&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn't as active a year as I had hoped but I still got some exciting work done. Im looking forward to the new year and all the opportunities to come in the next 12 months. A new large format printer is on the way right now and I have my first exhibition coming up in March, so it's going to be a busy start to 2018. Happy New Year everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Venice Beach Pier</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Once a year I head out to Los Angeles for work, and if possible I take an evening to take the camera out somewhere new. In 2015 I drove up to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/11/08/leo-carillo.html&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Leo Carillo Beach&lt;/a&gt;, last year I went for a photo walk around downtown, and this year I planned on heading down to Venice Beach to watch the sunset at the pier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my flight in I woke up just as we were coming over the mountains surrounding Los Angeles, and was able to snap this quick shot from my iPhone. I love the layers of mountains and cool colors. I wanted to get a shot like this when I was in Oregon but never had the chance to hike up Saddle Mountain while I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/IMG_6512.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always I was on a tight schedule, so I arrived about a half hour before sunset. Walking down the beach I watched the surfers, swimmers, and people playing in the water, all while getting my feet wet. Most people were wrapping up for the day and I took this photo of a surfer coming out of the water while trying to find angles to shoot from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A2736.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://photoephemeris.com/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;The Photographer's Ephemeris&lt;/a&gt; I knew exactly where and when the sun would be setting, and without fail I had the spot I wanted to shoot from picked out before I even stepped foot in California. It worked perfectly, and I was lined up and ready to go with plenty of time. I wanted to get the pier in silhouette with the waves crashing up the beach as the sun set directly behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A2888.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined with the difficulty of shooting straight into the sun behind the pier, I also was calf deep in the waves, having to jump up a few times to avoid getting completely soaked. It was worth the effort as you can see in the next shot, with the waves flooding in just inches below the lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A2849.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While jumping in and out of the water I was running all over the beach to get as many angles as I could. As the sun was at the horizon line I swapped over to my 70-200 2.8 to get some close ups of it dissappearing with the people on top of the pier running and fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A2978.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept the 70-200 2.8 on at 70mm until the sun completely disappeared behind the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A3017.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Just a sliver left...&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing people don't realize about sunsets is that it's not over when the sun completely sets. About ten minutes afterwards you get some truly amazing colors painting the sky. I had switched back to my 16-35mm and attached it to my tripod. Knowing that the surf pulls sand from underneath the feet I firmly pushed the tripod down an inch or two and waited for a few waves to break before shooting some long exposures. At f/16 I was exposing for 10 seconds each which was tricky with the water, but watching the ebb and flow of the waves I captured this without any shaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A3181.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After packing up my gear I took a long walk up the beach back to Santa Monica and headed back to the hotel. Sure, I was only out for about an hour overall, but it was worth the trek down to the coast. On my flight back to Chicago I glanced out the window to see another sunset, but this time over Iowa. I snapped a few photos and then called it a trip. Till next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

        <title>The Solar Eclipse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The North American Solar Eclipse has been on my calendar for about two years, so now that it's past I am incredibly relieved everything went smoothly. The long build up allowed me to be as ready as I could be, however nothing could have prepared me for actually &lt;i&gt;experiencing&lt;/i&gt; it first hand. I had mapped out where we were going to be, even made my own &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2017/01/08/preparation.html&quot;&gt;solar filter&lt;/a&gt; months ago, I was ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned to have my 5DMkIII setup with a 600-1000mm lens on my Celestron CGEM mount. At 1000mm the sun almost fills the frame so I would back it down to 600mm giving me room to capture the flares, which if that was all that I got, I would call a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secondary 6D would sit on a standard tripod with my 16-35mm wide open. I realized about a month out that the path of the eclipse wasn't so much of an arc, but more of a gentle horizontal curve. With the sun at 60&amp;deg; up it was going to be very hard to get both the horizon and eclipse path in frame without doing some sort of composite shot. That was going to be a tough one to crack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing I couldn't control was of course the weather. Things were looking good about 5 days out, but Saturday afternoon all of that changed. Multiple sites were reporting thunderstorms and clouds on Monday afternoon. A lot of people in my astronomy club threw in the towel and said they would stay home, but a few others were still committed. I was on the fence so I spent  most of Sunday afternoon checking forecasts and planning alternate spots for my best chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to head down to Fulton, Missouri as planned to meet up with everyone since the next eclipse won't be happening until 2024 I figured why waste the opportunity. To avoid any traffic I left late Sunday night, camping overnight a few miles away, arriving early Monday morning. At first light things were looking pretty good with minimal cloud coverage at 7am, and those were clearing out pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/morning-eclipse.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Monday morning&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We specifically chose Fulton since it was relatively small compared to Columbia to the West and St. Louis to the East - we wanted to be off the beaten path. I was the first to arrive at Little Dixie Conservation Area and was the only observer there for a while. Once people started coming in after 8:30 or so we started getting our gear setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/IMG_5752.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Setting up our gear&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/eclipse-setup.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;5D MkIII with the 600-1000mm on a Celestron CGEM mount&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/eclipse-wide.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;6D with a 16-35mm wide open&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main concern was getting a good sharp focus on the sun since the 600-1000mm lens was 100% manual. Pointing at something that bright makes it very uncomfortable looking through the eyepiece so I took some test shots to get everything set long before the partial phases started. On my first test shot I realized that I could see a small number of sun spots on the surface so I was in focus and ready to go. I taped down the focus ring to avoid bumping it out of place when removing the filter for totality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/0K6A9083.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Focus test - note the three sunspots&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting both cameras set I went to get my CGEM mount tracking the sun so I wouldn't have to mess with it during the eclipse, only to run into problems getting it tracking properly. I ran through the motions a number of times but just couldn't get it going, Since it was so hot and I was frustrated I scrapped that idea and would just manually guide the camera through the eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everything was setup and ready we walked around a bit to meet and chat with everyone who came down to view the eclipse, letting some curious people look through our scopes, and just generally soaking in the experience. We talked to a couple of young PHD students from MIT and UW Madison who were studying particle physics, one gentleman came all the way down from Ontario, another group was from Aurora and worked with my old boss oddly enough, and there were a large number of people from all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/mark.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mark sharing his wisdom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/IMG_5754.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A few people were really excited to be there&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partial phase started at about 11:36am but totality wasn't until 1:15, so we were in for a long morning of observation. The later it got more and more clouds rolled in, but thankfully we were getting windows of clear sky to shoot through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/0K6A9126.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The partial phase begins&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the eclipse progressed it didn't get noticeably darker, however the temperatures went from almost unbearably hot to comfortable in the hour leading up to totality. More and more cars were coming in but it was never anywhere near busy. Everyone was getting very excited. Our group was probably the most experienced so we were shouting out the countdown as it happened to let everyone know, as well as answering all kinds of questions from the curious people walking around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/midway.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Midway through&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/0K6A9212.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Nearing totality&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before totality I ran over to the 6D and switched it from one minute intervals to shoot every 10 seconds instead. What I didn't notice is that one of the kids running around must have kicked or accidentally  moved the tripod so it skewed the camera, throwing off my planned final wide shot. It wasn't a huge deal as the camera had a hard time adjusting the exposure settings in Aperture Priority mode. At the very least it did get a few frames during totality of us looking up during the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/IMG_9695.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Totality - you can see me in the lower right of the frame just watching for a minute&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totality was an amazing experience, and I can't properly articulate it at this point. It got extremely dark and the birds stopped chirping, everyone started cheering and clapping, and fireworks were going off in the distance. I had to stop taking photos to just stand up and take in the eclipse with my own eyes - what an amazing sight. Of course with a two minute window I didn't have a ton of time. I was bracketing my exposures a full stop on either side to capture as much as I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/totality.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Nine shot stack of Totality&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheering continued until totality had commenced when we shouted &quot;GLASSES BACK ON!&quot; as we didn't want anyone burning their eyes out. There was another round of cheers and excitement due to it being the first eclipse for a lot of people there. I was surprised that afterwards a lot of people piled into their cars and left. I continued to shoot the second partial phase between the clouds, and breathed a big sigh of relief knowing that at the very least I got the shot I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/solar-eclipse-progression.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Progression&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everything was said and done we packed up and headed out, thankfully avoiding the massive traffic delays that everyone was afraid of. I am glad I got to travel down and shoot the eclipse in its entirety and am already planning a large family trip out east for the 2024 eclipse. I hope everyone had a safe and enjoyable eclipse, save those glasses!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Telescope Mount</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My Celestron Ultima 11&quot; Schmidt Cassegrain telescope was originally built in 1995, and while the optical tube was in great shape, the original fork mount was getting pretty out-dated. It was difficult to assemble and almost unmanageable by one person alone. On top of that, it only had a simple clock drive for star tracking. While thats fine for basic viewing, its woefully inadequate for astrophotography. It was definitely time for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to get a new Celestron CGEM computerized german equatorial mount. This would replace the old and heavy bolted on forks for a lightweight dovetail bar that simply clamped into the mount. I triple checked that I would be able to switch from the fork to a dovetail, made a list of everything I would need, and placed my order. Adorama shipped the order surprisingly quickly and before long I had a huge pile of boxes in my living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/the-pile.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The UPS man came&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;CGEM Mount, Tripod, Dovetail, and a PowerTank&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boxes look pretty bad but that was exaggerated by the sleet coming down while going from the the truck into the house. Thankfully it all was packed extremely well and made the trip without any damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened up the CGEM box first, and my immediate impression was that it's extremely substantial and well built. Pictures don't do this thing justice - I firmly believe that if left outside during a nuclear attack it would remain intact. Considering it needs to hold the OTA plus camera gear and any accessories it is a &lt;i&gt;crucial&lt;/i&gt; part of any astrophotography setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/unboxing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Celestron CGEM Computerized Mount&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Unboxing the CGEM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the tripod and mount together I unpacked the new dovetail bar and got down to removing the optical tube from the original fork mount it was on. This was surprisingly easy as it is simply attached with four bolts at the base of the tube. I had to be very careful removing the original mount without scratching the coating on the optical tube - luckily it came out with only a few nicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the tube was off the original mount I also removed the accessory bar and finder scope so I could give everything a good cleaning before assembly. Attaching the new dovetail bar provided me with the only 'gotcha' moment of the entire process. It seems new Celestron OTAs use different thread sizes for the forward and aft mounting bolts, so two of the four supplied bolts wouldn't fit. A quick trip to the hardware store and I was back in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/dovetail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CGEM Dovetail Bar&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The dovetail bar that bolts to the OTA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original mounting bolts were long enough that without the mount they would screw down far enough to make contact with the mirror itself. Not good, so I'll need another trip to the hardware store for some shorter ones. You can see bolts sticking out of the back of the tube in the photo below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/entire-mount.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Celestron CGEM Computerized Mount&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The CGEM Computerized Mount&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing at 6'6&quot; tall I am very pleased with the eyepiece height when the tripod is fully extended. While I don't plan on doing much viewing myself it is nice to have things up at my height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I re-mounted the finder scope and balanced the entire assembly using the 17lb and 11lb counter-weights. With everything setup the new equatorial mount is smooth as silk, I am thoroughly impressed. Unlocking the clutches I could move the telescope around with one finger and no slack in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/cgem.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Celestron CGEM Computerized Mount&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The CGEM Computerized Mount&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I have to get the telescope out in the field on a clear night for a good practice session. I have to dial in the polar alignment which will be easier than before but still essential, as well as explore using the hand controller and Go To features. I'm very excited and checking the weather daily, but it being March will have to be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on sharing my journey as I learn more about astrophotography, so I will be posting more frequently as it warms up - stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Schmidt Cassegrain Maintenance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After impatiently waiting a month for clear skies I finally got my 'new' Celestron Ultima 11&quot; Schmidt Cassegrain out for a test run. I couldn't get tack sharp focus so I knew a collimation was in order and looking closely at the corrector plate I found some mold or mildew had built up on the inside of the glass. This was going to be a challenge but if I wanted amazing photos out of it I had to get it cleaned and properly aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/test-run.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Early morning test run&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Early morning test run&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching a few videos online and reading quite a few forum threads, I decided to use a mixture of 60% Isopropyl Alcohol and 40% distilled water, with sterile cotton to dampen, clean, and dry the plate. I gathered my supplies, thoroughly cleaned my workspace, and got down to business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/supplies.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Supplies for cleaning the telescope&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Gathering my supplies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to mark the position of both the retaining ring and the plate itself to ensure when reassembling everything went back to exactly where it was before. The easiest way to do this was to place two pieces of tape and mark them, slice them evenly during disassembly, then line them back up when putting the plate and ring back in. This was much more important for the corrector since it could go in at any angle, at least the ring was limited to it's screw holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I removed the retaining ring and marked the plate the same way, with one additional mark on the glass incase the tape came off. Once it was out I took a close look at the primary mirror and found it to be in great shape - I didn't want to have to touch that, so I gave it a few puffs of compressed air and then sealed the tube while I went to work cleaning the corrector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secondary mirror also looked perfect, so I started gently dabbing the corrector with distilled water and cotton swabs. Once it was thoroughly soaked I started dabbing with the cleaning solution, slowly spinning it as I worked my way around a few times, swapping out the cotton every so often (they are cheap, use a lot of them to avoid moving dirt around). Another round of dabbing with distilled water and I finally started dragging the swabs outward towards the edge, putting no pressure on them other than the weight of the swab itself, still slowly spinning after each swipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would pick up the assembly and closely inspect it every so often to ensure things were going smoothly. It looked a hundred times better after one pass on each side, but I did another full water/solution/water cycle on both sides of the glass again. Once that was completed it was looking amazing. A few puffs of compressed air removed any cotton debris, a quick round with the camel hair brush, and it looked perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had the scope open and didn't want to have to do this again any time soon I took another look up close under the lights to make sure I got everything off. It still looked great, so I began reassembly. I gently slipped the plate back into the tube and lined it up with the tape marks, then tilted the scope upwards a little bit removing the chance of it falling out before I got the ring in. I removed the tape pieces and quickly did a mini cleaning where they were, even though it would be completely covered by the ring, I wanted everything as clean as it could be. Then I remounted the retainer ring and screwed it back in place, slowly working opposite screws until everything was back in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly I was very nervous about the whole process, but being prepared with all the supplies needed, a good clean workspace with great lighting, and a written down and rehearsed plan made things go extremely well. Once everything was back in I tried to replicate the 'before' photo but the glass was so clean my iPhone couldn't focus on it. I'd say that was a job well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is a new Celestron CGEM computerized mount to replace the simple clock driven fork mount, another good collimation, and I should be in really great shape.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preparing for the Solar Eclipse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On August 21st of this year there will be a full solar eclipse passing over the central United States, with the center linel cutting through southern Illinois. Since this will only be a few hours south of me, I will be driving down and photographing the event. The last one I can recall was in the early 90's and I was in middle school, so I am quite looking forward to seeing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/eclipse-path.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The path of the solar eclipse&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't shoot the sun without heavy filters on your camera so I ordered a black polymer filter sheet from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thousandoaksoptical.com/solar.html&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; alt=&quot;Thousand Oaks Optical solar filters and accessories&quot;&gt;Thousand Oaks Optical&lt;/a&gt; to use with my 600-1000mm lens. A lot of sites recommend you just rubber band the sheet over the end of the lens but I wanted a nicer (and re-useable) solution than that. I have a 100mm square filter holder for my regular ND filters, so I decided to put together some kind of insert for the sheet to slip inside my holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ND filters are 100mm squares and only 1 or 2mm thick, so the challenge is to make something rigid enough to 'frame' the solar filter yet thin enough to slip into the holder. I poked around with a few different kinds of cardboard but everything was too thick or too flimsy until while getting breakfast the other day I grabbed a box of Cheerios and realized the cardboard was absolutely perfect. Rigid and thin, I could cut two pieces out and using an exacto knife cut a window for the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/IMG_3656.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Roughing out the filter holder&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The edges didn't have to be perfect since they were outside the field of view plus this will probably be proof of concept until I can find a better material. I cut down the solar filter sheet and taped it into the frame, then taped the two frames together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/IMG_3657.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Filter sheet inside the frame&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheet is delicate and even though I was careful I somehow scratched the front of it. Not a big deal, the sheet itself was only a few bucks. I put everything together and mounted it in the filter holder attached to my lens making sure the silver side is facing the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/IMG_3667.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mounted on the lens&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar filter is so dark that the sun is the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; thing you can see when its mounted so getting the camera aligned with the sun and focused is a bit of a trick without burning out my left eye. I found that when I squint while shooting with my right eye behind the camera my left eye is still kind of open, enough to where if I am pointing at the sun its very uncomfortable. I slid my hat down over my left eye and kept the right behind the camera so I was safe. Focusing was tricky, but I got dialed in and started making exposures. To my surprise I had to bump my ISO to 800 while shooting 1/250th of a second but I figure I can probably drop my shutter speed a bit when it's on the tripod. I will probably grab a blanket or some kind of hood on my next test run so I can use live view to get even sharper focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/0K6A2771.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;First test of the solar filter&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is to search for a better material to use as a filter frame, however if I don't find anything I know that using this simple method works just fine. I'd also like to try using a hood over the tripod so I can focus better without getting blinded in the process. Remember you have to be very careful while viewing or photographing the sun, as even a second or so of direct contact can damage your eyes or equipment. I'll post some more updates as I make progress.&lt;/p&gt;
