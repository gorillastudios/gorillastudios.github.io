        <title>Week 26 - Bald Eagle</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/adult-bald-eagle.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 29th - Adult Bald Eagle&lt;span&gt;1/320, f/4.5, ISO100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a break from cityscapes and architecture, this week I packed up my gear and headed back out into nature. A friend and I
went out for a morning shoot around the Fox River with no particular goal in mind, however we chanced upon two fisherman who told
us that some bald eagles had nested north of us in Mooseheart, where the juveniles were getting ready to fly for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving at the location it was obvious where the nest was. Bald eagles have the largest nest size of any bird in North America,
or possibly anywhere period. I estimate it was probably a good 8-10 feet around, and equally as deep. The juvenile bald eagle is a
very dark brown with a few white feathers poking out at various spots on their body. Their heads are not white, nor are their beaks
yellow until adulthood, which is at about 5 years old or so. It was very difficult to get any clean photos of the juveniles since
the pine tree was fairly thick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of watching them we noticed an adult in an adjacent tree staring at us very closely. There is very little
difference between the male and females, the only distinct difference being size - the females tend to be about 25% larger than the
males. Judging by the size I presume this was the father. He hopped around a little bit when we spotted him presumably to watch us
closer, but didn&#39;t move apart from that. I took this with a 70-200mm 2.8, and this is a 100% crop which tells you how high up he was.
I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, but I was taken aback at how good their eyesight was. On exposure after exposure you could plainly see they
were watching us extremely closely - constantly looking right down the barrel of the lens. These are truly majestic creatures and I
hope to get a chance to photograph them flying and feeding at the river.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 25 - Manhattan</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/p52/25.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 19th - Manhattan&lt;span&gt;80s, f/9, ISO400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weeks Photo52 challenge was, obviously, taken during my &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/06/23/NYC/&quot;&gt;trip to NYC&lt;/a&gt; last weekend. This shot was from the first night down in Brooklyn, just across from the southern tip of Manhattan. Brooklyn Bridge Park is a gorgeous location on the west side of Brooklyn overlooking the river and there are so many great locations for shooting the skyline. This location is on the far south of the park, where there is a dilapidated boat launch surrounded by these wooden posts poking out of the water. I knew if I could open the shutter long enough to smooth out the water it would be a great effect. As the sun dipped below the horizon there were some really ugly clouds that took up the right side of the sky, but at the last minute they finally cleared. I had a 2 stop neutral density filter on a Canon 16-35mm f/2.8 wide angle lens, and was exposing for 2-4 minutes each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular exposure was taken at 80 seconds and since it was at f/9 the streetlights on the horizon didn&#39;t turn into giant starbursts like they would at lower f-stops. The composition is probably my favorite part of this - the wooden posts and clouds all lead you right into the center and right side of the frame where One World Trade Center is standing tall. I was hoping to get the Statue of Liberty in the left side of the frame, but there was a large open air sports complex off camera left jutting out into the river that blocked her. Hopefully I can go back and explore NYC again soon, there is so much to capture and nowhere near enough time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weekend in New York</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I had the opportunity to travel to NYC for Generate Conference, a Web Design gathering in the heart of Manhattan. Of course I jumped at the chance and spent all my free time exploring the city with my new 5D MkIII. After a long weekend I am exhausted but heading home with full memory cards and some beautiful shots to add to my portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 1 - Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday I packed my bags, picked up a Canon 16-35mm 2.8 from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lensrentals.com&quot;&gt;LensRentals.com&lt;/a&gt; and headed off to O&#39;Hare. I got in and surprisingly breezed through security I decided to trek over to Terminal 1 to take some shots of the tunnel of lights that connect the two parts of the terminal. There are two long moving walkways on either side but unfortunately one of them had big ugly construction gates on each entrance so shooting from either end was out of the question. I quietly setup my tripod and walked around a bit finding my angle, finally settling midway down the second set looking the long way back. I took an exposure of 1s at f/7.1, ISO2000 which captured enough light while blurring out the passengers enough to create some interest in the foreground. I have always loved coming down here since I was a little kid, so it was a real treat to get it on film for once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/ohare-tunnel.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 19th - O&#39;Hare&lt;span&gt;1s, f/7.1, ISO2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once boarded I made sure my bag was below the seat in front of me and not above so I could grab my camera at any point. Knowing Chicago like the back of my hand and having a good guess of where the flight path was, I was fairly sure that we were going to pass along the north side of Chicago right after takeoff. Thankfully I was on the right side of the plane in a window seat so I was in the perfect position to grab whatever I could get. Sure enough right after takeoff we were cruising over the far north side, so I fired off a couple shots as the city came out from under the wing. I only had a window of a second or two because we started flying into some heavy clouds which obscured our view. Its always tough shooting out airplane windows and this was no exception. The haze from the glass was pretty bad, as well as the overall fog. After this shot things got really choppy so I had to put away the camera and try to stay calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/takeoff.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 19th - Chicago Skyline&lt;span&gt;1/250, f/8, ISO100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight finally calmed down and I got into La Guardia, making my way to the hotel by mid-day. I was a little worn out but I didn&#39;t want to waste any time so I hopped the A train down to Brooklyn Bridge Park on the Brooklyn side of the river. From the park there are a large number of really beautiful views of one of my favorite pieces of architecture (seriously, I just finished reading &lt;i&gt;The Great Bridge&lt;/i&gt; by David McCullough), so I walked around about an hour before sunset scouting where I was going to shoot during magic hour. I went south to a location I had seen on Google Maps where there were a bunch of pylons in the water which I thought could make for an interesting foreground during a long exposure. To minimize the impact of the clouds that were rolling in I added a 2 stop ND filter to make my exposures even longer, finally settling on 4 minutes at f/11. I wish the sky was clearer, but I still really like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/manhattan.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 19th - Manhattan Skyline&lt;span&gt;240s, f/11, ISO50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it was quite late and the lighting wasn&#39;t that good I wanted to scout another location while I was down there, so I headed north of the bridge, finding a great location on a boardwalk area at the very tip of the park. Looking back I made this exposure of 90 seconds at f/16. The sky is granier than I like but its still a beautiful image that I want to see in print. After getting up and out the door by 6:30, travelling all day and lugging my camera gear all over New York, it was close to 11 so it was finally time to head back to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/brooklyn-bridge-dark.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 19th - Brooklyn Bridge&lt;span&gt;90s, f/16, ISO100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 2 - Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday was spent at the conference which was a lot of fun, but afterwards I wasn&#39;t up for the typical after conference bar crawl. I made my way over to Grand Central Station to check out the great hall there, but I quickly realized it was an absolute zoo. I am usually okay in crowds but this place was over the top. There was zero chance of setting up a tripod with all the pushing and shoving, so I made some hand-stabilized shots from a balcony. Of the 10 or 15 shots I attempted only two or three  were clear. I was shooting around 2-4 seconds each but was really struggling with anything longer than three seconds. After about 5 minutes I&#39;d had enough, I was out of there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#39;vertical&#39;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/grand-central-standing.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 20th - Grand Central Terminal&lt;span&gt;3.2s, f/11, ISO100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t want to push myself too hard so I meandered around Midtown and checked out the scenery, eventually taking a stab at the famous New York slice of pizza. First place I tried looked okay, but was a dud, strike one. After a disappointing early dinner I rounded the corner to find myself right by the Chrysler building, one of Manhattan&#39;s crown jewels. I felt I was a little too close but shot a few frames to be sure, and was actually impressed with this shot when I converted it to black and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#39;vertical&#39;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/chrysler2.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 20th - Chrysler Building&lt;span&gt;1/200, f/8, ISO100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more wandering and I finally decided to head back to Brooklyn since the weather was much more cooperative. This time I got closer to the bridge, settling in at the best spot on the boardwalk just north of the bridge. There were about five photographers to my right and more over my left shoulder. This time the clouds added just a touch of drama to the shot, the lighting was amazing, creating almost a spotlight effect behind One World Trade Center, and I even got a party boat going upriver adding extra lights streaking across the frame. Certainly one of my favorite shots in recent history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/brooklyn-bridge-blue.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 20th - Brooklyn Bridge&lt;span&gt;90s, f/16, ISO50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 3 - Saturday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Saturday my feet and shoulders were telling me to slow down since I had lugged my camera gear all over Manhattan the past two days, so I stayed around Central Park. Grabbing some doughnuts I had a lovely breakfast down by Sheeps Meadow then wandered up to Strawberry Fields, the memorial just across from the Dakota Building where John Lennon was shot. As always it is surrounded by very inconsiderate tourists so taking a clean shot of the tiled &#39;IMAGINE&#39; is tricky. I watched a performer sing a few Beatles songs, finally tipping him after a great rendition of Here Comes The Sun, and snuck over to the circle. Nobody seemed to notice the mid-size stick that was laying over the G and I, or they just didn&#39;t care, but its small details like that that drive me nuts. Most people kneel down and give the peace sign while someone else takes their picture, so there are only split second windows where you can take an un-obstructed shot. I snuck in and grabbed the stick, throwing it into the grass, and had to patiently wait for my window. The area is covered by trees and the sun was beaming down creating a tricky shooting environment. I finally got this one between the gawking tourists. This shot I had wanted to re-take ever since my first trip to NYC when I got it with a point and shoot sometime around 2003, so needless to say I was a bit relieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/imagine.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 21st - Strawberry Fields&lt;span&gt;1/40th, f/8, ISO100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the sun started setting it was time for another shot I had planned long before coming to NY. I had wanted to take a dusk shot at the Flatiron Building at 5th Avenue and Broadway for a very long time. I scouted the shot and picked my location then headed off for another New York slice - trying 2 Brothers Pizza on 24th and was not disappointed. I grabbed two 1$ slices and headed back to Madison Square Park to eat and wait for sundown. I got my camera setup and started taking some test exposures, honing in my composition and making sure everything was ready to go, only to realize to my dismay that the Flatiron doesn&#39;t light up at night. There are a lot of things you can plan for, but sometimes its just not in the cards. I did manage to take this shot of the traffic zooming by, and while its a good shot, its rather flat and gray. I guess thats as close as I will get to a true nighttime shot of one of my favorite NY icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/flatiron-horiz.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 21st - Flat Iron Building&lt;span&gt;42s, f/13, ISO50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I headed back to the hotel I decided to stop back at the 5th Ave Apple store. This is one very tricky
exposure at night - you have to open the shutter long enough to get details in the foreground and surrounding
buildings but not blow out the Apple logo in the cube. I finally landed on an exposure around a third of a
second at f/11, ISO1600. This was taken at a very low angle, I was sitting on the sidewalk right next to a
hot dog vendor with my tripod completely collapsed. I kind of assumed the police officer was going to shoo me
along since I was sitting there for the better part of an hour, but he was incredibly friendly and didn&#39;t seem
to have any issues with me being there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/apple.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 21st - 5th Ave Apple Store&lt;span&gt;0.3s, f/11, ISO1600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 4 - Sunday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sunday I was almost ready to drop, but I wanted to meet up with some family that lived in the city now that our schedules lined up. After brunch I started walking around Lexington and the mid-50&#39;s when I stumbled upon a wonderful building that was almost circular, completely glass and absolutely fascinating. I took some photos and was kind of standing around just admiring the architecture when an Audi pulled up and parked (after almost hitting me) and the driver proceeded to tell me that it was private property and there was no photography allowed. The key in any of these situations is to remain calm and determine what your rights are at that time. I was on public property, and I calmly informed him of that. He insisted that there was no photography, to which I asked if he was the building owner, building security or NYPD. He mumbled something and started walking away, again almost yelling that there was no photography allowed. I raised my voice a bit but calmly told him that I wasn&#39;t taking photos of him, and if he wanted to take it up with the police I was more than happy to speak to them. He kept walking, finally disappearing around a corner. I turned around to find a doorman looking at me sheepishly. I kept shooting and he just smiled at me, it was the second time I have been yelled at when taking pictures, and of course the other time was again in New York, back in 2003. Anyway, I finished up some more shots and finally made my way back to the hotel, then off to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#39;vertical&#39;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/fight.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 22nd - Altercation&lt;span&gt;1/40th, f/8, ISO100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were delayed coming out of LaGuardia but as we took off and banked around I spotted Manhattan out the window and scrambled to get out the camera. Unfortunately I was experimenting with some time-lapse work in the airport and had left it in JPEG mode. I quickly switched into Shutter Priority and dropped it to 1/60th, just a vague guess at something that was hand-holdable, slow enough to get some light in and yet fast enough not to blur as the plane moved. I snapped a few frames and noticed some bad glare coming from the cabin lights so I had to quickly try to shield as much of the window as I could. You can see from Central Park at the bottom of the frame all the way up to the Statue of Liberty which is the far right speck of light just above (in frame) Manhattan proper. It&#39;s not going to win any awards, but it&#39;s a great way to say goodbye to NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#39;vertical&#39;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/nyc-night.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 22nd - NYC Flyover&lt;span&gt;1/60th, f/2.8, ISO12800&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip was a lot of fun and I was able to get some amazing photographs thanks to all the planning I did beforehand. I scoured Google Maps, Google Streetview, and Google Earth looking for some unique places to shoot from, which really paid off. I still have more shots to process and take a closer look at later, but for now it&#39;s back to the day job.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 24 - Union Station</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&#39;vertical&#39;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/black-white/columns.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;June 16th - Union Station&lt;span&gt;1/30, f/8, ISO160&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have found it difficult to keep up with the Photo52 project over the past few weeks I have been using my iPhone to try to get at least a photo a day. In doing so I have been exploring a few tools to really see what I can capture with it. Until recently I haven&#39;t been blown away by anything other than the convenience of having it in my pocket at all times. I have started using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instagram.com/gorillastudios&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; quite a bit, which originally I hadn&#39;t cared for all that much. Instagram has released a new version of the app with better editing controls, really expanding (at least in my opinion) what it can do. I also purchased an app called &lt;a href=&quot;http://vsco.co/vscocam&quot;&gt;VSCOcam&lt;/a&gt; which I am very pleased with (more on those later). One thing I have found in using my iPhone every day is that its a great scouting tool to let me almost &#39;sketch&#39; out ideas for shots before returning with my SLR. That is exactly what happened this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I commute into the city each day I get to see a lot of beautiful architecture, and of course every day I get to walk through Union Station. The Great Hall is gorgeous, but there are some interesting spots outside the building as well. This photograph is looking south from the east exit of the main building. If you turn facing north there is a big ugly view of a CVS sign through the archway, so I prefer this angle. The lines can be tricky, however scouting the day before helped me get the shot I wanted very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 22 - Chicago Sunset</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/chicago/sunrays.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;May 29th - Chicago Sunset&lt;span&gt;1/160, f/8, ISO50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, after a long hiatus I am finally back into the swing of things. Lately we have been getting some spectacular sunsets here in Chicago so I decided to head out and see what I could get on a very windy Thursday afternoon. I picked up a Divvy bike just around the corner from my office and headed down to the lake. To say it was windy is an understatement. It was close to 70 in the afternoon, but after a half hour I was uncomfortably cold. Not much really grabbed me as there was a pretty thick haze over the city, so I grabbed another Divvy and peddled my way around the Field Museum campus just to kill some time before sundown. A side note, I now consider a Divvy key fob to be an essential part of any Chicago-based photographers toolkit. Instead of lugging my gear all over the loop I was able to just pull a bike and head to where I want with very little effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After circling Solider Field and the Shedd Aquarium I braved the bitter wind and went back down to the lake by the Adler Planetarium, one of the best spots in the city to see the skyline. The haze started to part, but when the sun started dipping below the buildings it ducked down right behind 311 S. Wacker to create these beautiful sunbeams casting past the Sears Tower and right over the lake. I wanted to get in tight so I switched to my 55-200mm and shot that wide open at 55. I love the sun bursting out from the buildings, the silhouette of the skyline is much different than most shots with all of the lights on. I like how this one turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Canon 70-300mm IS L</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to get my hands on a Canon 70-300mm IS L lens to play around with, and I had to share my initial impressions. I took a quick trip down to Navy Pier to play around with it and see how it handles in the field. The lens is all metal, so it is incredibly sturdy weighing in above 2 pounds. On a Black Rapid strap I didn&#39;t feel much fatigue letting it hang at my side, but shooting with it certainly gave my arms a good workout. While I wasn&#39;t blown over by the AF performance I was taken aback at how sharp the images came right out of the camera. I wanted to share two specific photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/seagull.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Cawing Seagull&lt;span&gt;1/160, f/8.0, ISO125&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This noisy guy was hovering around the few tourists, trying to get scraps of food from wherever he could find it. I snapped this photo at 300mm (this is a 100% crop). I couldn&#39;t believe the detail on the birds beak, incredibly sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/seagull-2.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Seagull Portrait&lt;span&gt;1/160, f/6.3, ISO100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was another portrait shot of a seagull that was perched on a railing, again shot at 300mm. The texture around the eye was what makes this photo pop. Incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the lens for another few days so I want to run it through its paces some more, and when I do I&#39;ll share some more photos.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Exposure Triangle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past Friday I gave a 5 minute lightning talk at my work about the basics of photography and how you can get out of Auto mode. Instead of sharing the slides I want to expand on the talk I gave and write something more substantial. With entry level DSLRs becoming very affordable these days lots of amateur photographers are entering the market having never touched a film SLR, and generally have a very rough understanding of camera fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three basic settings on the camera that are crucial to every photograph - photographers commonly refer to this as the Exposure Triangle. Every photograph is a balance of three settings - &lt;strong&gt;ISO, Aperture, &amp;amp; Shutter Speed&lt;/strong&gt; - and I want to talk about each one and how they affect each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ISO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, ISO is how sensitive the camera&#39;s sensor is to light. If you&#39;re old enough to remember buying film you might recall that it had an ISO rating between 50 to about 1600 give or take. With modern DSLRs it can range from 50 to 100,000+. Having the camera on a low ISO setting, say 100, will produce crisp noise-free images, but it will not be very sensitive to light. Setting the camera to a high ISO, say 25,600, will make it much more sensitive to light allowing faster shutter speeds, the images will have noticeable noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/iso-example.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;(left)ISO 50 - (right)ISO 25,600&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two examples from real world shooting. On the left is a photo I took of a Great Blue Heron grooming itself one morning. I was shooting directly into the sun (not recommended at all) so I needed to drop my ISO down to 50 and raise my shutter speed to 1/4000th so I wouldn&#39;t blow out the image. The example is cropped but the original is sharp and almost completely noise free. On the right is a photo I took while shooting the Everly Hillbillies in concert. It was very dark and the drummer was poorly lit so I needed to raise my ISO to 25,600 to get enough light while opening the shutter for 1/200th of a second and you&#39;ll notice the image is extremely noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aperture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of Aperture like the iris of your eye - it is simply the adjustable size of the lens opening. This controls how much light comes through the lens to the sensor, as well as affecting depth of field. One thing students get caught up on is the terminology of how aperture is measured, in f stops. High apertures are when the lens allows the most light through, and conversely low apertures let the least light through. The confusing part is that high apertures are smaller numbers, and low apertures are high numbers. Lets take a look at two examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/aperture-example.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;(left)High Aperture f/2.8 - (right)Low Aperture f/16&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the left is a Macro image taken at a very high aperture - f/2.8. For this shot the lens opening was as wide as it could go, allowing as much light as possible into the camera. This also created an extremely shallow depth of field (extremely exaggerated since it is a macro shot). The right image was taken at a very low aperture, f/16, letting very little light into the camera but getting almost everything in focus, from a few feet in front of the camera all the way to the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shutter Speed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the easiest to understand and causes so many headaches for inexperienced photographers. Shutter speed is simply how long the cameras sensor is exposed to the light coming in through the lens. When you press the shutter button the mirror allowing you to see through the lens from the eyepiece springs upward and the shutter curtain snaps open and then closed almost instantly. Shutter speed is measured in fractions of a second, usually between 1/4000th of a second, down to multiple second (or minute) exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/shutter-example.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;(left)Slow shutter 1/4th - (right)High shutter 1/2000th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow shutter speeds usually cause blurry and shaky images if not done properly. However if you use a tripod (or an very steady hand) you can create some interesting effects when slowing the shutter speed down. On the left is a shot of a London double decker bus passing in front of Elizabeth Tower. Using a monopod I slowed my shutter down to a quarter of a second to make sure the bus was blurred out, yet it was fast enough to hold steady so the tower itself was still sharp. In order to freeze motion you need a higher shutter speed. On the right is a shot of birds flying into my parents bird bath. They were flitting about extremely quickly so I had to set the camera to 1/2000th of a second in order to even come close to freezing the motion. You can see they were so fast that the wings were still blurred out even at that speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb for shutter speed while hand held is it should never be slower than the focal length. I.e at 50mm lens should not be hand held for exposures under 1/50th, 200mm no less than 1/200th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How the triangle works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each setting impacts the other two so finding a balance between the three is critical to any exposure. If an exposure is too dark you can try to slow your shutter speed down, increase your ISO, or open up your aperture. If you want a longer depth of field you need to close down your aperture, but increase your shutter speed or ISO to compensate. If you don&#39;t understand how each side of the triangle works and how it impacts the others then practice until you do. This is the foundation of photography and having a working understanding of them is of the utmost importance. We&#39;ll dive deeper into all three in later posts, but until then, keep practicing!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 8 - Chicago By Train</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/p52/08.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;February 24th - Chicago By Train&lt;span&gt;1/100, f/16, ISO100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been taking a series of photos during my morning commute into the city from the train, and this weeks entry is my favorite from the past few days. While very similar to Week 1, this time I decided to slow my shutter speed down to introduce some motion blur in the foreground while keeping the subject and background sharp. After pulling the photo into Lightroom it looks like I panned from left to right to keep the water tower in frame, dragging the exposure a bit - the consequence of this is that the water tower is sharp, the foreground is extremely blurred, and the background is just barely blurred. This panning technique is used by photographers to keep very fast moving subjects in focus while blurring out the background, emphasizing motion.&lt;/p&gt;
