        <title>Leo Carillo Beach</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I flew out to Los Angeles for a conference, and had a small amount of free time the night before so I drove up the Pacific Coast Highway to Leo Carillo State Beach. Having scouted this location on Google Maps weeks before flying out I had a very good idea of the shots I wanted to get, knowing that at sunset I only had a good hour of what I consider to be perfect light. I didn&#39;t know when I would be back out, so I had to make the most of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that Google Maps couldn&#39;t quite emphasize is how steep the cliffs leading down to the beach were. I thought it would be pretty easy to get around, so when I arrived I realized that it was actually incredibly steep and difficult to navigate. Despite the challenges I setup quickly and found a spot overlooking a rocky outcropping where a large number of Cormorants were drying off as the sun started to dip down to the horizon. I wanted to capture the motion of the waves breaking over the rocks which was rather challenging while maintaining a proper exposure. In this situation I really wish I had a graduated ND filter, but you do what you can with what you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A0660.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Leo Cariollo Beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also didn&#39;t want to spend my limited time in one spot so after getting a few exposures I was satisfied with I collapsed my tripod down and made my way to the north section of the beach. It was actually rather tricky getting down as the sun was setting making it difficult to tell what were actual paths and what was just erosion from water run off. Once down on the beach I started photographing the backside of the rocky formation I was shooting from above on the cliff. The cormorants had flown away, but one seagull was perched atop the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A0772.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Leo Cariollo Beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing north there were a few interesting rocks half buried in the sand like icebergs, poking out and breaking up the water as the waves quickly slid up the beach. I lowered my tripod all the way down and got almost on top of one, being extremely cautious of the incoming tide. Waves were making their way up the beach at a good rate, a few of which soaked my jeans that I had rolled up over my knees. I started opening up the shutter for 2 to 5 seconds a time smoothing out the water as it wrapped around the rocks and receded back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A0758.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Leo Cariollo Beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun had gone down completely at this point and light was disappearing fast, so I had to make my way back up to the road before I lost all light and it would be rather dangerous walking around. As I was trekking back to the car I walked past a life guard station silhouetted against the fading sunset, so I hurriedly made a few exposures. With an exposure of around 30 seconds you could still see hints of detail in the tower which I thought gave it a small sense of scale, but I like how its almost completely black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A0789.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Leo Cariollo Beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my first shot to last I was only on the beach for an hour, so you can see how little time I actually had. I could probably spend each night for a week here and just start to get the shots I want - I didn&#39;t even get down to the small cave that was tucked away in the cliffs. On top of that, this is just one of hundreds of beaches surrounding Los Angeles. I&#39;d love to come back out in the future and shoot some more here as well as drive up to Natural Bridges State Park in Santa Cruz. I&#39;m happy I got to come out to California even if just for a brief time and am looking forward to when I can return in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A starry night in DeKalb</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I was heading back from downstate IL when my GPS took me a different route than I was used to, and on the way I stumbled across this old weather-stripped barn on one of the backroads in DeKalb, IL. The county is full of them so I am always on the lookout for any that have a lot of character that stood on their own and this one fit the bill nicely. I made a note of it&#39;s location and thought about how I wanted to photograph it at some point. I&#39;ve done quite a few rural photos of barns, especially when I was getting started, however they were all during the day, and due to my inexperience, mostly in the worst light imagineable. I had always wanted to shoot a starscape through the roof of an old barn at another location, but I thought this might be a better opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/google-maps-dekalb.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Scouting the location beforehand in Google Maps&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning from the dissapointment of being in Sedona during a full moon I checked the calendar to see when the next new moon was so it would be as dark as possible, the only variable would be clouds. I checked the weather in the afternoon and everything looked great, so at about 12:30am I packed up my gear and drove out to the farm. As I pulled up I found there was a street light about 20 yards behind the spot I would be shooting from and I realized that this would actually light the barn nicely. I was worried beforehand that it would be a silouhette shot without some kind of fill flash on the barn but after the first exposure I found that it was lit absolutely perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One challenge I always have with landscapes at night is composition - it&#39;s much too dark for a live-preview, and if I wan&#39;t to shoot from close to the ground its really uncomfortable getting down and looking through the viewfinder. Thankfully at 19mm I can just eyeball it and after about 2 or 3 exposures I get locked into the composition I had in mind. I dialed in to a 20 second exposure to ensure the stars didn&#39;t streak but it allows enough time at ISO2000 to get a balanced exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A6846.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A starry night in DeKalb IL&lt;span&gt;20s, f/6.3, ISO2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light from the street was absolutely perfect, but it did throw off the color temperature a bit which is easy enough to fix in post. The night sky has a very dreamy feeling to it which I love, creating a very meditative photograph. I think I am going to head back in a few weeks during the next new moon to take it to the next level and make my first attempt at star-trails.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 20 Year Photo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first time I picked up an SLR camera was some time in early 1995. To this day I can&#39;t really explain what drew me to photography, but I think it has to do with the intersection between art and technology. I was fascinated at how this bulky metal box stuffed with a mirror, prism, mechanical shutter, and a little strip of 35mm film could produce what I was seeing in National Geographic. During my freshman year in High School I took Intro to Photography which to this day is the extent of my formal education in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately loved it, I was shooting as much as I could while trying not to go broke buying roll after roll of 35mm film. In 1998 my dad purchased a Sony Digital camera that literally used 3.5&quot; floppy discs in the back, which held about 10 photos. Between then and 2003 I used a few different digital cameras but never felt as comfortable as I did with that beat up old Nikon film SLR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The path to mastery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003 I purchased a brand new Canon EOS 10D Digital SLR and I was on top of the world. The problem was that my ambitions were far ahead of my skill level. I was aware of it, but not consciously. I wanted to take amazing photos and be able to share them, and I was getting frustrated at the disconnect between what I had in my head and what was shoing up on the back of the camera. I knew it would take hard work, but I couldn&#39;t grasp how much. At some point I came across this quote by Ira Glass which stopped me in my tracks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You&#39;ve got to get rid of a lot of crap before you&#39;re going to get anything that&#39;s special.  You don&#39;t want to be making mediocre stuff.  There&#39;s a gap for the first couple years that you&#39;re making stuff. What you&#39;re making isn&#39;t so good. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is good enough that you can tell what you&#39;re making is kind of a disappointment to you. A lot of people at that point, they quit. The thing I would say to you with all my heart is that most everybody I know who does interesting, creative work, went through a phase of years where they had really good taste, they could tell what they were making wasn&#39;t as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short. Everybody goes through that. If you&#39;re going through it right now, or if you&#39;re just starting off and you&#39;re entering into that phase, you&#39;ve got to know its totally normal and the most important thing you could do is a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work because it&#39;s only by actually going through a volume of work that you&#39;re actually going to catch up and close that gap.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
- Ira Glass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was exactly where I was. I knew what I wanted to do, I had clear visions in my head of the photos I wanted to take but I wasn&#39;t there yet. I would look at my portfolio and know it was mediocre at best, but that didn&#39;t stop me, I didn&#39;t give up. Being a card-carrying geek I heard that there was going to be a lunar eclipse, so I knew it would be a great opportunity, so I grabbed my tripod &amp;amp; telephoto lens and headed out to see what I could get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/moon-fail.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;My first attempt at a lunar eclipse. &lt;span&gt;November 8th, 2003&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so disappointed with the results I was almost defeated. Everything was blurry, I couldn&#39;t get the exposure balanced correctly, it wasn&#39;t in focus, I had so many problems and why? I just spent a ton of money, this should look like it belongs on the cover of Astronomy Magazine right? I was using the same tools as the pros, but I didn&#39;t know how to get the same results. I was somewhat aware of things I needed to learn, but there was a wealth of information I didn&#39;t know was even out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Practice, practice, practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept pushing myself to try again, learning different techniques, bringing my camera everywhere I went, and challenging myself to get better. Slowly I progressed and over time I started to improve. Sometimes I would take a photograph that would make me stop and say &#39;yes, thats what I envisioned when I pressed the shutter button&#39;. I found the ratio of bad shots to good shots became less and less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansel Adams is arguably the greatest landscape photographer of all time, and he said this about his work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Twelve significant photographs in any one year is a good crop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally feel this is a pretty good target to hit. This may seem like nothing in todays digital age where everyone has an Instagram account with more pictures of their lunch than Adams ever put on film in his lifetime, but I think it holds true when talking about creating art, not just snapping photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Periodically I look back to see the progress I have made, I save every shot I take specifically for this reason. I can pull up photos tagged with &#39;moon&#39; and see the quality improving over the years. After a few more attempts, here is a shot of a waxing gibbous moon from 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/moon-intermediate.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Waxing gibbous moon. &lt;span&gt;March 25th, 2007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of four years I had improved remarkably but it was almost impossible to realize in real time. I learned how to focus manually in the dark, how to lock the mirror up to avoid shaking the exposure, how to properly stabilize my tripod, and numerous other techniques that all combined to create a wonderful photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried. - Stephen McCraine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning I would probably get 1 good photo from 100 shots. This day I am happy with 1 in 50 to be honest. It&#39;s not just technical mistakes - it can be clipping a subject or bad framing, choosing the wrong viewpoint, shooting at the wrong time of day, or simply missing some detail in the photo. I don&#39;t just take photos, it takes effort to make a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although sometimes it takes a bit of luck, and in this case, a &lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/portfolio/fly-me-to-the-moon.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fly me to the moon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;March 18th, 2011&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most of the time its preparation, knowledge, and execution. When I heard that there would be another lunar eclipse in a week I knew I had an opportunity to take the photo I had wanted to take since I first picked up that old Nikon. I looked back at all my previous astrophotography shots to see what worked so far and what didn&#39;t. I read some materials to refresh myself on the exact techniques, and most importantly I went out the night before to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/practice.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Practice shot, night before the eclipse&lt;span&gt;September 26th, 2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only could I take the photo I wanted to take in 2003, more importantly I could take a stacked progression of the eclipse that wasn&#39;t even a thought back then. This time I was ready. Since I had gone out the night before to practice I had a good starting point, slowly adjusting my exposures over the three hour event. I took my time, I wasn&#39;t rushed or panicked, I was prepared. Here is probably the most difficult shot of the bunch, the eclipse at it&#39;s apex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/lunar-eclipse-peak.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lunar eclipse at its peak. &lt;span&gt;September 27th, 2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selecting a good set of exposures I was able to make a 10 shot progression of (nearly) the entire eclipse. The clouds parted just after I started and rolled in just before it ended, but it was enough of a window to get the majority of it. I sent over the order to the printer last night, so in a few days I should have a few 40&quot; by 10&quot; prints ready to frame, one for myself and a couple to sell. I can&#39;t wait to see them in such a large format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/lunar-progression-tall.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;10 shot progression of the lunar eclipse. &lt;span&gt;September 27th, 2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;...it took me my entire life.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Legend has it that Pablo Picasso was sketching in the park when a bold woman approached him.&lt;br /&gt;
  &amp;quot;It’s you — Picasso, the great artist! Oh, you must sketch my portrait! I insist.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
  So Picasso agreed to sketch her. After studying her for a moment, he used a single pencil stroke to create her portrait. He handed the women his work of art.&lt;br /&gt;
  &amp;quot;It’s perfect!&amp;quot; she gushed. &amp;quot;You managed to capture my essence with one stroke, in one moment. Thank you! How much do I owe you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
  &amp;quot;Five thousand dollars,&amp;quot; the artist replied.&lt;br /&gt;
  &amp;quot;But, what?&amp;quot; the woman sputtered. &amp;quot;How could you want so much money for this picture? It only took you a second to draw it!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
  To which Picasso responded, &amp;quot;Madame, it took me my entire life.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t feel as I am a master photographer yet, and am in no way comparing myself to Picasso, but I really like that quote. The lunar eclipse progression I took on September 27th 2015 technically only took me fractions of a second for each frame to make, but in reality it took 20 years of hard work, many failures, even more learning, reading, patience, and practice to create.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bigfoot Bandcamp</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend I headed down to Cedar Point IL and had a blast photographing the Bigfoot Bandcamp music festival. If you are looking for a truly unique, laid back and intimate atmosphere, this was the place to be. The festival was held in a huge campground with the stage in the center so you could literally hop out of your tent and walk right down to the stage. A huge lineup of unique acts combined with a very laid back environment makes this an event you don&#39;t want to miss. I have it marked on my calendar for next year already. I got down after the show started, but I got to see Jaik Willis, Evacuate The Earth, The Voodoo Fix, The Krank Daddies, and topping the bill was The Reverend Horton Heat. Throw in some fire dancers, hula hoopers, and a burlesque show, its one of the best festivals I have ever been to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;half-and-half&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/bfbc/0K6A3771.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/bfbc/0K6A4479.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Jaik Willis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t able to get down to the show until early afternoon, but when I arrived Jaik Willis was taking the stage. I was floored when he opened with a solo acoustic cover of Master of Puppets, beatboxing the rhythm section and pushing his acoustic guitar to the edge. An energetic set and a very unique talent, he was a lot of fun to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/bfbc/0K6A3814.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Jaik Willis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&quot;/jaik-willis&quot;&gt;all the photos of Jaik here&lt;/a&gt;, and you can find more information about Jaik and where he is going to be on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jaikwillis.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;his website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Evacuate The Earth&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next was Evacuate The Earth. I love bands that don&#39;t stick to the routine and I knew I was in for something special when I noticed the lead singer with two saxophones, a flute, a bull horn, and her own drum. The bassist had a theremin which needless to say you don&#39;t see very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/bfbc/0K6A3878.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Evacuate The Earth&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see &lt;a href=&quot;/evacuate-the-earth&quot;&gt;all my photos from their set here&lt;/a&gt; and more information about them on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.evacuatetheearth.net&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Voodoo Fix&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short break The Voodoo Fix stormed onto the stage. They recently moved from LA to Nashville where, from what I saw, they are going to make a huge splash in the local scene and well beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/bfbc/0K6A4252.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Voodoo Fix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see &lt;a href=&quot;/the-voodoo-fix&quot;&gt;all my photos from their set here&lt;/a&gt; and more information about them on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thevoodoofix.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Krank Daddies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Krank Daddies came on stage and tore it up from the first second of their set. You have to respect any band that roars out a song called &#39;Johnny Cash Kicks Ass&#39;. I had a hard time keeping up with them, but it was a blistering set that left my ears ringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/bfbc/0K6A4302.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Krank Daddies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&quot;/the-krank-daddies&quot;&gt;all my photos from their set here&lt;/a&gt; and more information about them on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekrankdaddies.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reverend Horton Heat&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else can anyone say about the Reverend Horton Heat? He&#39;s been rocking since almost before I was born and hasn&#39;t lost a step since. I&#39;ve wanted to see him perform for years which makes it even more special that I got to shoot The Rev, Jimbo, and Paul. A great performance to cap off the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/bfbc/0K6A4771.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Reverend Horton Heat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;half-and-half&quot;&gt;

        <title>Morning on the L</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/mobile/IMG_2705.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend I was in the city and had to take the Orange line of the L down to the South Loop and because I didn&#39;t plan on doing any shooting, my 5D was packed in my camera bag at home. While waiting at the something station in the Loop I noticed the morning light streaming down onto the tracks from between two buildings creating a nice contrast between the shade and sunlight. With a train coming down the tracks at me I got my iPhone 4 out and snapped this photo. Im always nervous shooting with the iPhone because of the shutter lag from when I hit the button but I timed it perfectly so the lead car was in the morning sun. I was frustrated that I didn&#39;t have my DSLR on me but they say the best camera is the one you have with you so I should be happy that at the very least I have a camera in my pocket at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the result of this shot converted into black &amp;amp; white in Instagram left me pleasantly surprised, I like the level of contrast and sharpness. I still violently disagree with people who claim a smartphone can replace an SLR, but I believe they are good for casual shooting. Since it was about 8am on a Saturday the L was almost empty, so I headed back to the rear car to test out Instagram&#39;s Hyperlapse app. I had tried it once, but it was sitting at my desk or somewhere boring so I wasn&#39;t impressed - I wanted real world results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding the phone steady on the back door of the train I shot a time lapse of the Orange line leaving the Loop heading southbound, letting the camera roll for 2 or 3 minutes. Hyperlapse compresses it down so the final shot was only about 30 seconds at 10x speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was disappointed when I remembered that Instagram limits video to 15 seconds, the entire clip is pretty cool. I&#39;m not sure if the lag in the beginning is due to the limited processing capabilities of the iPhone 4 or something along those lines, I was just irritated it wasn&#39;t as smooth as I had hoped. I was impressed enough to want to take some more time lapses in the future, so we&#39;ll see if its the phone or something I did.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Campton Hills Road</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks I have been cataloging all my photos on my website in order to dynamically create galleries sorted by category, and in doing so I have dug up quote a few old photographs from my archive. This photo was taken back in 2006 on my trusty old EOS 10D - a 6.1MP DSLR that I bought new in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just west of the town I grew up in there was an old knotty tree that just kept catching my attention when I would drive by, so I decided to try to get an interesting photo of it. I made quite a few attempts - some in broad daylight which aren&#39;t anything special, a handful in a snowstorm which I printed out and gave to my parents, and then a number at night including this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/CRW_2285.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Tree along Campton Hills Road&lt;span&gt;15s, f/4, ISO100&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was when I was still learning long exposures, and while it&#39;s a good print, I wish I had gotten it during magic hour or closer to sunset. I lost a lot of details in the foreground (including the base of the trunk), and the overall exposure was extremely dark. Lightroom brought it up enough to display online, but at full resolution the sky doesn&#39;t look so good. I love that I got a silhouette of the tree with the leaves blurred by wind, the cars streaking by were completely intentional, but the plane coming into frame from above left was a happy accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had originally edited this as a black and white and let it sit for years, but it never really grabbed me. Looking at it again I realized the color version was much better, the light of the city combined with the very tail end of a warm midwestern sunset create something much more special than a black and white print can do. This is a prime example of why I always keep my original RAW files - there have been quite a few I go back to years later and rescue them from obscurity. Additionally the tree died and was finally cut down sometime around 2012, so I can&#39;t go and re-shoot in this location much to my dismay.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>James Thompson Center</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today on my walk to the train station after work I took a quick detour and randomly stopped into the James Thompson government center on Randolph and Clark in the Loop. It&#39;s the kind of place you could walk by a thousand times and not notice anything about it. I first went in years ago because there is a DMV in the basement, and thats when I realized the interior of the building is this beautiful open space all the way up to the ceiling, a sprawling web of glass and steel. The elevator stacks are exposed in the center, with offices wrapping around in a circle on the outside, and a large hole in the floor looking down to the basement level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked in and poked around a little bit, but there are restricted areas because it is a government building and they can be a bit picky about photographers. I went up to the first floor above the lobby and took some panoramas from floor to ceiling from each side. This is a 5 shot panorama from the left side of the first floor overlooking the lobby and down into the basement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;5 shot panorama&lt;span&gt;1/160th, f/8, ISO4000&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the blue glass near the entrance, and all the exposed staircases, so many little details that almost get lost in the photo. If you are downtown I recommend you at least stop in and look around for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Natural Light Portrait</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In most situations nothing beats natural light. This morning I was playing with my daughter in front of our large picture window when I noticed the light fall-off on the side of her face as she gazed outside. I knew just looking at her if I used a high shutter speed I could drop the background to a solid black even though the room was fully lit. It&#39;s actually a gloomy day outside which is perfect - clouds create the perfect diffuser, softening the light and removing all the harsh shadows that are present on a sunny day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/portraits/alison-seven-months.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Natural portrait&lt;span&gt;1/250th, f/4, ISO8000&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propped her up between my knees as she braced herself on the back of the couch. Leaning back I snapped a few photos, as she looked around. Composition was a little difficult because just to the left of the frame are the white window blinds which completely throws off the image. I cropped them out in camera, while keeping her to the right side. After a few test shots I landed on 1/250th of a second which was enough to drop the background completely black. I bumped the shadows just a touch to make it a bit more dramatic, adjusted the color temperature, sharpened up her eye and that was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adult portraits and other situations I do like using off-camera flash, but for simple, up close headshots and portraits, I still absolutely love natural light. During the summer I try to shoot during the early morning and evening to avoid harsh light, however when its cloudy thats the perfect time to shoot all day long. So don&#39;t be dissapointed on gloomy days, grab your camera and make something special.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wabash Ave</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While downtown I don&#39;t typically ride the L, and when I do it&#39;s usually work related so I am heading to client offices. Late last year I happened to get off of the brown line at Wabash &amp;amp; Adams where there is an overpass looking straight up Wabash with a clear view of Trump Tower. At the time I didn&#39;t have my camera on me, but I made a mental note to head back at some point with my gear to see what I could get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the beginning of March and the Chicago weather is still very poor so I decided to only take a few quick shots to see what I could get when the weather gets nicer. I quickly setup my tripod at the center of the overpass between platforms, looking north up Wabash. As the trains rumbled by the overpass would shake quite a bit, but I was surprised to find it didn&#39;t affect any shots. This exposure was taken for 15 seconds, f/8 at ISO100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/chicago/over-the-l.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timing the shots was particularly tricky - I wanted to get trains going in both directions, but being pressed for time I didn&#39;t have any luck in the 15 minutes I was there. Overall I like the shot with the one train streaking into the station, but I want to go back in the spring or summer when there isn&#39;t snow on the platform roofs and the sky isn&#39;t so overcast and dull.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Selective Sharpening</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This month has been exclusively shooting portraits of my daughter as we play in the morning, so my portrait editing skills have been getting better and better lately. Here is a sharpening technique that I have been working on recently. For most of my landscape work I just do a simple Unsharp Mask applied to the entire frame which isn&#39;t the best technique since it isn&#39;t that flexible..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example here we have a portait of Alison, zoomed in half way to get a good feel for whats happening. First I duplicate the background layer, then go to Filter &amp;gt; Other &amp;gt; High Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/sharp/step1.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layer will turn a dark grey with the edges of your subject are visible. I adjust the slider until the eyes are reaslly standing out a bit, but not too much. If you do go too high you can always adjust later, thats the great thing about this technique is its non-destructive and easily adjustable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/sharp/high-pass.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the layer from Normal to Overlay. While holding Option click create layer mask. By holding Option it will fill the layer mask with black. On a layer mask black is transparent, showing the layer below, while white makes it opaque, showing the layer sharpened with our High Pass filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/sharp/overlay.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the sharpened layer transparent, we can use our paint brush to selectively sharpen only what we want. Make sure you have the black layer mask selected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/sharp/select-mask.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select a soft paint brush and make sure its white. Paint over the eyes and you can see the sharp layer coming through. You can see here I painted over her left eye - you can see how sharp it is compared to her right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/sharp/mask.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this to paint over the eyes, nose, and lips, sometimes the ears and chin as well depending on the photo. Once you have painted over the areas you want sharp, then you can adjust the opacity of the layer to make sure its not too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing it this way we only sharpen what we want, and the rest of the photo is smooth - this is even better with photos taken at really wide apertures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/sharp/final.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d like to see this technique in action here&#39;s a quick screencast:&lt;/p&gt;
