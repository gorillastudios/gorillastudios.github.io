        <title>New Telescope Mount</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My Celestron Ultima 11&quot; Schmidt Cassegrain telescope was originally built in 1995, and while the optical tube was in great shape, the original fork mount was getting pretty out-dated. It was difficult to assemble and almost unmanageable by one person alone. On top of that, it only had a simple clock drive for star tracking. While thats fine for basic viewing, its woefully inadequate for astrophotography. It was definitely time for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to get a new Celestron CGEM computerized german equatorial mount. This would replace the old and heavy bolted on forks for a lightweight dovetail bar that simply clamped into the mount. I triple checked that I would be able to switch from the fork to a dovetail, made a list of everything I would need, and placed my order. Adorama shipped the order surprisingly quickly and before long I had a huge pile of boxes in my living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/the-pile.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The UPS man came&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;CGEM Mount, Tripod, Dovetail, and a PowerTank&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boxes look pretty bad but that was exaggerated by the sleet coming down while going from the the truck into the house. Thankfully it all was packed extremely well and made the trip without any damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened up the CGEM box first, and my immediate impression was that it&#39;s extremely substantial and well built. Pictures don&#39;t do this thing justice - I firmly believe that if left outside during a nuclear attack it would remain intact. Considering it needs to hold the OTA plus camera gear and any accessories it is a &lt;i&gt;crucial&lt;/i&gt; part of any astrophotography setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/unboxing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Celestron CGEM Computerized Mount&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Unboxing the CGEM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the tripod and mount together I unpacked the new dovetail bar and got down to removing the optical tube from the original fork mount it was on. This was surprisingly easy as it is simply attached with four bolts at the base of the tube. I had to be very careful removing the original mount without scratching the coating on the optical tube - luckily it came out with only a few nicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the tube was off the original mount I also removed the accessory bar and finder scope so I could give everything a good cleaning before assembly. Attaching the new dovetail bar provided me with the only &#39;gotcha&#39; moment of the entire process. It seems new Celestron OTAs use different thread sizes for the forward and aft mounting bolts, so two of the four supplied bolts wouldn&#39;t fit. A quick trip to the hardware store and I was back in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/dovetail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CGEM Dovetail Bar&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The dovetail bar that bolts to the OTA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original mounting bolts were long enough that without the mount they would screw down far enough to make contact with the mirror itself. Not good, so I&#39;ll need another trip to the hardware store for some shorter ones. You can see bolts sticking out of the back of the tube in the photo below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing at 6&#39;6&quot; tall I am very pleased with the eyepiece height when the tripod is fully extended. While I don&#39;t plan on doing much viewing myself it is nice to have things up at my height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I re-mounted the finder scope and balanced the entire assembly using the 17lb and 11lb counter-weights. With everything setup the new equatorial mount is smooth as silk, I am thoroughly impressed. Unlocking the clutches I could move the telescope around with one finger and no slack in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/cgem.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Celestron CGEM Computerized Mount&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The CGEM Computerized Mount&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I have to get the telescope out in the field on a clear night for a good practice session. I have to dial in the polar alignment which will be easier than before but still essential, as well as explore using the hand controller and Go To features. I&#39;m very excited and checking the weather daily, but it being March will have to be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on sharing my journey as I learn more about astrophotography, so I will be posting more frequently as it warms up - stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Schmidt Cassegrain Maintenance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After impatiently waiting a month for clear skies I finally got my &#39;new&#39; Celestron Ultima 11&quot; Schmidt Cassegrain out for a test run. I couldn&#39;t get tack sharp focus so I knew a collimation was in order and looking closely at the corrector plate I found some mold or mildew had built up on the inside of the glass. This was going to be a challenge but if I wanted amazing photos out of it I had to get it cleaned and properly aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/test-run.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Early morning test run&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Early morning test run&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching a few videos online and reading quite a few forum threads, I decided to use a mixture of 60% Isopropyl Alcohol and 40% distilled water, with sterile cotton to dampen, clean, and dry the plate. I gathered my supplies, thoroughly cleaned my workspace, and got down to business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/supplies.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Supplies for cleaning the telescope&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Gathering my supplies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to mark the position of both the retaining ring and the plate itself to ensure when reassembling everything went back to exactly where it was before. The easiest way to do this was to place two pieces of tape and mark them, slice them evenly during disassembly, then line them back up when putting the plate and ring back in. This was much more important for the corrector since it could go in at any angle, at least the ring was limited to it&#39;s screw holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/mark-it.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Marking the position of the retaining ring and corrector plate&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Marking the position of the retaining ring and corrector plate&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I removed the retaining ring and marked the plate the same way, with one additional mark on the glass incase the tape came off. Once it was out I took a close look at the primary mirror and found it to be in great shape - I didn&#39;t want to have to touch that, so I gave it a few puffs of compressed air and then sealed the tube while I went to work cleaning the corrector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secondary mirror also looked perfect, so I started gently dabbing the corrector with distilled water and cotton swabs. Once it was thoroughly soaked I started dabbing with the cleaning solution, slowly spinning it as I worked my way around a few times, swapping out the cotton every so often (they are cheap, use a lot of them to avoid moving dirt around). Another round of dabbing with distilled water and I finally started dragging the swabs outward towards the edge, putting no pressure on them other than the weight of the swab itself, still slowly spinning after each swipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/dabbing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cleaning the corrector plate&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Cleaning the corrector plate&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would pick up the assembly and closely inspect it every so often to ensure things were going smoothly. It looked a hundred times better after one pass on each side, but I did another full water/solution/water cycle on both sides of the glass again. Once that was completed it was looking amazing. A few puffs of compressed air removed any cotton debris, a quick round with the camel hair brush, and it looked perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/plate-cleaning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cleaning the corrector plate&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Cleaning the corrector plate&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had the scope open and didn&#39;t want to have to do this again any time soon I took another look up close under the lights to make sure I got everything off. It still looked great, so I began reassembly. I gently slipped the plate back into the tube and lined it up with the tape marks, then tilted the scope upwards a little bit removing the chance of it falling out before I got the ring in. I removed the tape pieces and quickly did a mini cleaning where they were, even though it would be completely covered by the ring, I wanted everything as clean as it could be. Then I remounted the retainer ring and screwed it back in place, slowly working opposite screws until everything was back in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/before-after.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Corrector plate, before and after&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The corrector plate before and after.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly I was very nervous about the whole process, but being prepared with all the supplies needed, a good clean workspace with great lighting, and a written down and rehearsed plan made things go extremely well. Once everything was back in I tried to replicate the &#39;before&#39; photo but the glass was so clean my iPhone couldn&#39;t focus on it. I&#39;d say that was a job well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is a new Celestron CGEM computerized mount to replace the simple clock driven fork mount, another good collimation, and I should be in really great shape.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preparing for the Solar Eclipse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On August 21st of this year there will be a full solar eclipse passing over the central United States, with the center linel cutting through southern Illinois. Since this will only be a few hours south of me, I will be driving down and photographing the event. The last one I can recall was in the early 90&#39;s and I was in middle school, so I am quite looking forward to seeing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/eclipse-path.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The path of the solar eclipse&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&#39;t shoot the sun without heavy filters on your camera so I ordered a black polymer filter sheet from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thousandoaksoptical.com/solar.html&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; alt=&quot;Thousand Oaks Optical solar filters and accessories&quot;&gt;Thousand Oaks Optical&lt;/a&gt; to use with my 600-1000mm lens. A lot of sites recommend you just rubber band the sheet over the end of the lens but I wanted a nicer (and re-useable) solution than that. I have a 100mm square filter holder for my regular ND filters, so I decided to put together some kind of insert for the sheet to slip inside my holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ND filters are 100mm squares and only 1 or 2mm thick, so the challenge is to make something rigid enough to &#39;frame&#39; the solar filter yet thin enough to slip into the holder. I poked around with a few different kinds of cardboard but everything was too thick or too flimsy until while getting breakfast the other day I grabbed a box of Cheerios and realized the cardboard was absolutely perfect. Rigid and thin, I could cut two pieces out and using an exacto knife cut a window for the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/IMG_3656.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Roughing out the filter holder&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The edges didn&#39;t have to be perfect since they were outside the field of view plus this will probably be proof of concept until I can find a better material. I cut down the solar filter sheet and taped it into the frame, then taped the two frames together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/IMG_3657.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Filter sheet inside the frame&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheet is delicate and even though I was careful I somehow scratched the front of it. Not a big deal, the sheet itself was only a few bucks. I put everything together and mounted it in the filter holder attached to my lens making sure the silver side is facing the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/IMG_3667.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mounted on the lens&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar filter is so dark that the sun is the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; thing you can see when its mounted so getting the camera aligned with the sun and focused is a bit of a trick without burning out my left eye. I found that when I squint while shooting with my right eye behind the camera my left eye is still kind of open, enough to where if I am pointing at the sun its very uncomfortable. I slid my hat down over my left eye and kept the right behind the camera so I was safe. Focusing was tricky, but I got dialed in and started making exposures. To my surprise I had to bump my ISO to 800 while shooting 1/250th of a second but I figure I can probably drop my shutter speed a bit when it&#39;s on the tripod. I will probably grab a blanket or some kind of hood on my next test run so I can use live view to get even sharper focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/0K6A2771.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;First test of the solar filter&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is to search for a better material to use as a filter frame, however if I don&#39;t find anything I know that using this simple method works just fine. I&#39;d also like to try using a hood over the tripod so I can focus better without getting blinded in the process. Remember you have to be very careful while viewing or photographing the sun, as even a second or so of direct contact can damage your eyes or equipment. I&#39;ll post some more updates as I make progress.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My top 10 images of 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am continuing my tradition of taking the end of the year to review my photographs over the last 365 days and create a selection of 10 images that represent my best work over that time period. This year was mostly focused on family and work so I didn&#39;t get the chance to shoot as much as possible, but I was able to get some time in Chicago, Portland, and London which I am very grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find my best work I have a smart gallery in Lightroom set to this calendar year + anything thats rated 3 stars or above. At the end of the year I start weeding out weaker shots, taking a few passes to get the collection down to the top 15 or so. This year I started with a set of 56 images, which seems about average for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2016-finalists.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Photos in 2016 rated 3+&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few passes I narrowed it down to my 10 strongest. Lets take a look at what I chose, presented chronologically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I work about two blocks from the Sears Tower and its between my office and the train station, I find myself constantly snapping photos and getting different looks at the building. In March when it started warming up a bit I wanted to see what kind of details I could get in the glass bottom viewing platforms using my 70-200 f/2.8. You can&#39;t get directly underneath and shoot upwards since there is a large atrium on the west side of the building, so I tried an angle I hadn&#39;t seen before. I walked over to the corner of Adams &amp;amp; Wacker Drive, almost completely around the to the side of the building, where I could barely see the west face of the building. From that angle the boxes were very pronounced outwards, combined with the &#39;shoulders&#39; of the building making some interesting lines. A deep blue cloudless sky turned into a wonderful dark spotlight when converted to black and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A0939.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of March I found myself out in London on business, and while I didn&#39;t have much time I was able to sneak out for a late night shoot along the Thames where I took this photo of Millennium Bridge and St. Paul&#39;s cathedral. I love the mixture of colors reflecting in the river in contrast to the almost purple night sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A1416.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May I headed out west to Portland Oregon, and while I was there I ventured out to Cannon Beach. An iconic beach instantly recognizable to anyone who has seen &lt;i&gt;The Goonies&lt;/i&gt;, Haystack Rock is a beautiful rock formation over 200 feet tall jutting out of the Pacific coast. I spent two nights shooting sunsets from various spots around the beach, both in and out of the water. My favorite shot was taken at sunset as the tide was creeping in and I could barely feel my toes. The waves breaking over the large rock in the center of the frame combined with how the rip tide washed out the foreground make this one of the best landscapes I have taken in some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A3261.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another location in Portland I visited was Multnomah Falls just outside Portland. After a serious rain shower cleaned out the tourists I had a few minutes before it filled back up again. Making sure I had my rain gear covering my camera, I got my 16-35 f/4 setup on the tripod and started exposing frames around 1 to 2 seconds, trying to smooth the rushing water as much as possible without over-exposing the highlights. The dull gray sky wasn&#39;t adding anything so I cropped in-camera to just below the horizon above, and just below the base of the falls. This was the first time shooting at 16mm that I wish I had a bit more range on the low end, as I couldn&#39;t get as much of the lake below as I would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A3635.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Chicago, again shooting the Sears Tower, this time it was more of a learning exercise. I picked up some stackable ND filters so I wanted some practice making exposures with an ND16 (or more) sitting in front of the lens. I was able to open the shutter for 30 seconds at f/16, which on a windy day created the wonderful cloud movement that I was hoping for. After importing these into Lightroom I sat on them for a few months not paying them another thought. It wasn&#39;t until I started diving deeper into Lightroom&#39;s black and white conversion tools that I went back and took a closer look, which I am very glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A8841.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining my ND filters with a straight up composition I used for some commission work earlier in the year I took some more black and white photos of various skyscrapers in the Loop. This next frame was taken on Wacker Drive and Monroe of the Deloitte building, a newer building in the skyline. Some minor sharpening with a little burning of some shadows, but otherwise this was almost straight out of the camera. I was surprised how much contrast I had gotten from the pylon at the bottom of the frame with the ceiling of the ground floor. Another piece for my architectural portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A8852.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a brief trip to Los Angeles I was able to get out for one evening and was extremely lucky to make this photograph. I had digitally scouted quite a few areas around the city having only been there once before, finally deciding to shoot the Walt Disney Concert Hall after shooting the sunset from another location. I walked around a bit finally deciding to shoot from this angle. I fired off a test exposure, and made a few adjustments. In the middle of this exposure a police officer rode up telling me that there were no tripods allowed and I had to either shoot handheld or leave the premises. I heard the shutter click while I was talking to him so I quietly hit the remote one last time before he rode off, but I had to pack up my gear and leave which I was rather cross about. I could (well should have) taken some exposures from across the street but I was tired and hungry so I packed it in and headed back to the hotel. Looking back at the three shots I got I was delighted that the older couple taking a cell phone shot of the building stayed still for just the right amount of time. You can tell that they are all dressed up, the gentleman was wearing a very nice hat and suit, the woman in a wonderful dress. Contrasted against the angular and sharp building it made for a very nice overall composition. I am irritated that I couldn&#39;t spend more time on the property, but I do like what I was able to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A9996.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final three exposures were all taken in one day, almost on a whim. It had been a few years since I have shot in blizzard conditions and it&#39;s not something I particularly enjoy, but I can&#39;t argue with the results as some of my favorite landscapes are in the snow. Chicago was forecasted to get about a foot of snow over two days, so I thought I might be able to get something, but didn&#39;t have anything particular in mind. My wife sent me out to run some errands right as the storm hit which as it turns out was perfect. I grabbed my camera bag &lt;i&gt;just in case&lt;/i&gt;, but as I got about 2 blocks from home I realized that conditions were absolutely magical for some landscape work. Knowing I didn&#39;t have much time I headed over to Leroy Oakes Forest Preserve which is only a few minutes from my house. Typically it is over-run with portrait photographers doing family shoots, but when the weather gets foul they all disappear. Pulling in my first thought was to shoot a scene I had taken back in 2013, a row of trees leading off into the distance. It wasn&#39;t snowing as heavily back then so I was hoping for something softer and more washed out, which is exactly what I got. Struggling to keep the rain cover on while still accessing the camera I reviewed my first few shots - I knew I was on to something. A slight color temperature adjustment and some sharpening was all that was needed. The rest was mother nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A1968.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning around and trudging through calf deep snow drifts I looked up to see what, in the summertime is a rather ugly clump of trees, but was now turned into a magnificent scene just fading off into the snowstorm. Every distraction was already taken out of the frame by the blanket of snow on the ground and even more coming down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A1975.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept trying different angles as I made my way closer and closer to the &#39;front&#39; of the outcropping, finally getting what has to be one of my all time favorite shots. The snow was coming down so heavy that everything beyond about 20 or 30 feet was completely washed out. Grabbing a few more frames I headed back to the car, resolving to come back the next time we got socked with snow, which of course we haven&#39;t had a single flurry since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A1986.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the timestamps from my last shoot I spent exactly 13 minutes from first frame to last. It was unexpected, rushed, improvised, and wonderfully magical. It was a great way to re-energize me heading into the new year. For most of my landscape work I like to sit on it for a week or so, then if it still catches my eye I make the best frame my desktop to see how it holds up after repeated viewings. If it can survive that I know I am on to something, and the last two shots I keep flip flopping on which I like more. They are holding up a month later, and I think are really going to stand out as some of my best work. Not bad for 13 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ready for 2017&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like doing this exercise to keep me excited and get me going more during the colder months. I definitely don&#39;t get out as much when it&#39;s cold and miserable outside, but a little end of the year retrospective always helps the winter blues. Here&#39;s to 2017!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Lightroom workflow</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally made the jump this fall and switched my photography workflow to Lightroom 5 full-time. Since at least 2003 I was using Bridge + Photoshop which I knew was not the most efficient way to do it, but it was comfortable and I was fast with it. When I first checked out Lightroom a few years ago I couldn&#39;t quite figure out the way to edit my most recent photos on the go while keeping the bulk of my library at home on my archive drives. After some more thinking, and some inspiration from Martin Bailey, I resolved all my issues and took the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/lightroom-flow.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Adobe Lightroom 5&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My photo catalog is quickly racing towards 2TB and while it&#39;s certainly not as large as some professionals, it&#39;s still big enough to cause headaches. I can&#39;t fit my catalog on my laptop, and smart previews just weren&#39;t going to cut it. After a little reading and testing I setup a workflow where I could have my cake and eat it too. There is a folder on my laptop called &#39;To Vault&#39; (The Vault is the name of my archive drive). I import all new photos into that folder, using a simple &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD - Subject&lt;/code&gt; folder structure, then open Lightroom and synchronize the folder which imports them into the catalog. Once I am finished editing the photos locally, I then use the Lightroom interface to physically move the source files to The Vault, which is duplicated to another off-site hard drive monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use Lightroom because I was sick of dealing with maintaining both the source catalog alongside a &#39;final edits&#39; collection which took up even more space. Lightroom is non-destructive meaning it saves all your &#39;edits&#39; in simple xml data files which it then applies to the RAW files when you open them in develop mode, that way the source RAW file isn&#39;t touched and the edits are only a few kb of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Organization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My rating system, while completely arbitrary, has served me well. Three stars is my baseline for anything that has the potential to be added to my portfolio, four stars for gallery images, and five stars are for my master portfolio - a set of 18-20 photos that showcase my best work. One and two stars are for family photos and client shoots which stay private excepting for their respective subjects. Using this structure allows me to setup smart galleries where I can quickly find my best work from a given time frame, or other constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a number of smart collections to keep things organized. A catch folder of anything rated higher than 1 in the last 30 days lets me review and edit my &#39;approved&#39; shots over the last month, meaning my last few photo shoots. I also have smart collections for anything rated 3+ for each calendar year which allows me to review and curate a set of best photos from each year. Additionally I like to go back and see if I missed anything, so I use a &#39;Review&#39; collection - setting it as the target collection I can go back and look over photos, tapping &#39;B&#39; to add them quickly so I can take a closer look later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2016-finalists.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;All photos from 2016 rated 3+&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editing photos is much faster than using Photoshop. All the adjustments needed are right at your fingertips and are  specifically designed for photo editing. For most photos all I usually do is set a lens correction, and make some minor tweaks such as exposure adjustments or spot removal. If I have to do any deep cloning or healing I will sometimes export to Photoshop, but that is only because I am still learning how cloning and healing work in Lightroom. A wonderful feature that I use every time is Before &amp;amp; After review pane. You can view both the original and edited views a few different ways to see how much you have changed - definitely not possible in Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/lightroom-comparison.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Developing and comparing to the original&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I am done editing a photo I can simply go back to grid view. I don&#39;t worry about exporting or saving an edited version unless I need to post on social media or deliver to a client. This keeps me from filling up drive after drive with the original RAW files AND edited versions of each. On export I can embed copyright information and watermarks, as well as constrain the image size by the long edge (very handy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overall impressions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sincerely impressed with Lightroom and wish I had made the jump sooner. I know I could upgrade to Creative Cloud for a monthly fee, but I don&#39;t like the idea of not being able to use it once I stop paying. Lightroom 5 has all the features I need for my workflow, and while there are a few neat tools in Creative Cloud, there is nothing that makes me want to upgrade any time soon. If you have any questions about how I import, organize, edit, or export my work feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;d love to chat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Leroy Oakes Forest Preserve</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Northern Illinois got it&#39;s first snow of the season when a few inches came down just before lunch yesterday. I hadn&#39;t taken the camera out for a while so I decided to head over to Leroy Oakes Forest Preserve here in St. Charles to see if I could capture some of the magic. It&#39;s a wonderful park just west of the city and while it&#39;s a hot spot for portrait photographers, I discovered years ago that when it&#39;s blanketed in snow there are some perfect spots for minimalist landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled in and sure enough there were a few families brave enough to be doing portrait sessions in the blustery snow. Just past the two barns where most of the portraits are taken is a small one room schoolhouse, Sholes School. Local grade-schoolers get to spend the day there in period costume learning about what it was like living here in Illinois back in the 1800&#39;s - which I myself was lucky enough to do back in second grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paired with my 16-35mm f/4, I stuffed my camera into a rain cover and jumped out of the car to see what I could get as the snow started coming down even harder. No one else was brave enough to face the deepening snow here, so the immediate area was untouched. I captured this frame from underneath a large tree on the walkway leading up to the school building itself.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/0K6A1952.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a white fence around the schoolhouse could use some repairs, but I think it adds to the overall charm of the property. In the next shot I was at 16mm so I stood only a few inches from the post in the foreground, the lens distortion made for an interesting composition. I had tried this exact shot years ago at 19mm and just wasn&#39;t happy, but this time around I am really pleased with the results that the extra 3mm gives me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/0K6A1960.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another shot I had taken years ago that I was hoping to re-visit was one of a row of trees near the entrance of the park. An access road since removed caused this set of trees to line up straight as an arrow, disappearing into the snowy horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/0K6A1968.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just on the other side of the main road stand another two trees leaning towards each other almost as if they are about to hug. I made this photo as the snow continued to pick up its pace, making it very difficult to see what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/0K6A2009.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visibility was dropping so I decided to turn around and trudge back to the car to see what I had gotten. Fortunately as I turned I realized that the very large bank of trees that normally I would completely ignore were naturally just fading away into the horizon, disappearing into the swirling snow. Captured almost entirely in camera this next photo was only sharpened a touch, thats all. I love how everything just fades out of frame without any after effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A1995.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept getting even closer as I tried a few different perspectives, finally taking what is my favorite shot from the day. This was from the very end of the row, while making sure the surrounding trees still faded into the snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A1986.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love taking minimalist landscapes and while snowstorms are difficult to shoot in, they create some wonderful results. Normally I don&#39;t wish for a lot of snow during the winter, but after yesterday&#39;s outing I am going to be keeping my eye on the weather reports hoping for some big storms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Star Trails - A Success</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month I went out and performed a test run for shooting star trails. It was a wonderful learning experience and despite the full moon along with the clouds rolling in halfway through I felt the end result was a great start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/star-trails-1.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Star trails test run&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a few reminder notes I checked the calendar for the next new moon and then kept a close eye on the weather report. When it finally cleared up I grabbed my gear and headed out to a small spot near Kaneville, IL where it looked to be fairly dark with minimal light pollution. Again I knew I wanted Polaris to be close to center of the frame so the stars would spiral around it. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve spotted constellations manually so I decided to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skyview-free-explore-universe/id413936865?mt=8&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Skyview Free&lt;/a&gt; to verify I was on target. I decided to try a vertical shot this time, looking over a small lake in the foreground with a tree breaking up the horizon to add some interest. I set my intervalometer for continuous 30 second exposures, grabbed my chair and settled in for an hour and a half of waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/star-trails-2s.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Star trails second run&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved how the sky turned out, Polaris was exactly where I wanted, but I wasn&#39;t in love with the composition. I didn&#39;t get enough reflection in the water as I wanted, and the horizon line was just too cluttered with the tree not standing out how I had imagined it. I chalked it up to another learning experience and started looking at the weather report again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later things were looking good. I had again scoured Google Maps looking for remote locations in the area with a large tree next to a field I could face north while shooting. I had found what looked to be exactly what I wanted out near Maple Park, IL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/star-trails-location.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next clear night I drove out to my spot and instantly knew I was going to get something special. I couldn&#39;t seem to get a good focus dialed in so I wound up backing my car up and turning on the headlights while pointing at the tree which did the trick. After verifying everything was set I sat down for another hour and a half session, shooting 120 frames for the final stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/lightroom-trails.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Lightroom I adjusted my exposure settings and applied them to all 120 frames and exported them to JPGs. The next step was to remove all the planes streaking by since I didn&#39;t want them in the final print. Thankfully being pretty far out in the suburbs there wasn&#39;t too many frames I had to fix. I had to stack them a few times to catch all the planes, but when I was finished I was extremely pleased I went through the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/star-trails-3.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final result was almost exactly what I had in my mind before I even made my first exposure, which is always extremely satisfying as a photographer. An hour and a half made some nice long trails farther outside Polaris, but next time I think I would like to try two or three hours to see how far I can push it. I am definitely in love with this type of astrophotography, and am looking for more opportunities to shoot star trails in different locations as well as during some upcoming meteor showers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Star Trails Test Run</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week a number of people started messaging me on the 11th asking if I was going to go out that night and shoot the Perseid Meteor Shower which was forecasted to have the most activity in recent history. I hadn&#39;t planned on it but after humming and hawing for a minute I decided to get my gear together and head out - only to find a large storm front rolling in and the sky completely covered by clouds. Extremely disappointed I decided to try shooting a star trail as soon as it cleared up again. Despite it being a full moon a week later, I went back out. Let&#39;s take a look at my first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most star trail photos aren&#39;t actually one photograph - they are a series of exposures stacked on top of each other and blended together. Before learning more about it I thought you would need specialized software or a lot of technical know-how to accomplish it, but as it turns out the process is dead simple and only requires Photoshop (there are specialty programs available as well). The benefit of it being a series of continuous exposures is that you are also treated with a nice time-lapse if you shoot for long enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to wind up with both a good still photograph and a short time-lapse video. Shooting with my Canon 5DMkIII + 16-35mm f/4 IS II, each exposure would be 30 seconds at f/4, ISO500 - anything longer and the stars start to blur in each frame (typically its about 20-25s, but at 16mm you have a little flexibility). Shooting for 90 minutes I would get about 7.5 seconds of video (180 exposures / 24fps = 7.5s). That would be enough for a test run to work out any bugs or something I overlooked. Ideally I was hoping to have the north star Polaris in frame so all of the stars would circle around it. In order to track it I downloaded a free iOS app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skyview-free-explore-universe/id413936865?mt=8&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Skyview Free&lt;/a&gt; which I cannot recommend enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lightpollutionmap.info&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Light Pollution Map&lt;/a&gt; I could see that I was going to have to head out into the farmlands to get dark enough skies to overcome the full moon. I chose a remote one-lane gravel road between two farms with zero traffic to set up camp. Since the corn was about 7ft high I popped the tripod on the top of my car and dialed in the exposure settings. Once everything was setup I took one exposure with the lens cap on so in post I could identify any hot pixels on the sensor, then grabbed a book and let the camera do its work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half hour later clouds started rolling in which meant my still frame was going to be much less dramatic than I had hoped for, but with some thunder claps in the other direction I was hoping to get something in the time-lapse, so I let it go for the full 90 minutes. Afterwards I packed up my gear and headed home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shot-sheet&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Exposure settings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Canon EOS 5D MkIII&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Canon 16-35 f/4 IS II&lt;/span&gt; - IS Off, Manual Focus&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Shutter speed&lt;/span&gt; 30s - Anything longer and stars start streaking&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Aperture&lt;/span&gt; f/4&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; 500 - Due to the full moon this was low, typically its around 2000 or so&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;White Balance&lt;/span&gt; 3000K - If you set it to auto it may shift, then you have to fix it in post.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Long Exposure Noise Reduction&lt;/span&gt; Off&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Image Preview&lt;/span&gt; Off&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/image-settings.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Importing your images and matching the settings (Bridge or Lightroom work just fine)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened up my first frame and made the final tweaks, then exported the settings to the entire batch* (more on this below). Once I had them all exported with the correct settings I opened up Photoshop and clicked &lt;strong&gt;File &amp;gt; Scripts &amp;gt; Load Files into Stack&lt;/strong&gt;. I found my source images, double checked that they were in the right order, and clicked OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that for the stack I only selected the first 40 or so images to keep the clouds in the bottom left side of the frame before they overtook everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/photoshop-stacks.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Importing your images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This opens every file as its own layer in a single Photoshop document. Once opened, I selected all the layers and changed the &lt;strong&gt;blend mode to Lighten&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/layers-to-lighten.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Change the blend mode to lighten&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was delighted to see the stars streaking nicely, to my horror there was a very obvious checkerboard effect over the entirety of the image. It wasn&#39;t on any single image, but as soon as I had two layers visible it appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/checkerboard.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Checkerboard bug&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* After some investigation online the effect appears from me applying a crop and slight rotation to each layer during the export process. Each frames adjustment is not pixel perfect which is enough to cause this strange phenomenon. To avoid this do NOT crop or rotate any of the source images before stacking them. Once your image is set and merged down to one layer then you can rotate and crop as needed. Lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned previously my first and last exposures are with the lens cap on. This is to pickup any &#39;hot pixels&#39; on the sensor - sometimes individual pixels don&#39;t record light correctly and show up as colored spots on the exposure. These would be the same in each frame, so the lens cap shot is my baseline to remove any should they pop up. Thankfully I didn&#39;t have any issues, but it is good practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I like how the final image turned out. I wish I would have included Polaris in the frame, but that just wasn&#39;t possible from my vantage point. Like David duChemin has said, this was merely a &#39;sketch&#39; of a final image I want to produce at some point. I learned a lot and can&#39;t wait for the next new moon in a week or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/star-trails-1.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Star trails test&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I wrapped up work on my still frame I grabbed the entire batch of images and went to turn them into a time-lapse video. Now I have done some in the past, and I swear you could do it right in Quicktime, but I wound up using a free Mac utility called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.panolapse360.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Panolapse&lt;/a&gt; The interface is a bit utilitarian but it got the job done. Take a look at the final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uynzz4wZ1VE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the clouds came and covered the entire sky, the flickering on the ground is from when they sporadically covered the moon. I learned a lot and will be much more confident when I go out during the next new moon to capture something really special. Stay tuned and happy star-gazing!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Arca-Swiss Tripod Mount + L Bracket</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During my recent trip to Portland the quick release plate on my Manfrotto ball head malfunctioned - the pin that holds the release lever open and ready for the camera to mount seized shut, meaning the latch doesn&#39;t stay open. Im pretty sure the combination of salty air and a small amount of sea water are the culprit. After a few days of hitting it with WD-40 then PB Blaster I had no luck getting the pin to move again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/IMG_1366.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Seized quick mount sitting in PB Blaster&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I could use this as an excuse to finally get myself a new Arca-Swiss compatible head and L-bracket, but I wasn&#39;t too excited about replacing the head itself since it was still in excellent condition. After a little bit of searching I found I could simply replace the ball head plate with an adapter, so I settled on a &lt;a target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Haoge-CP-58-Arca-Swiss-Compatible-Manfrotto-Replacement/dp/B01CAO7PR4?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=ox_sc_act_title_1&amp;smid=AST9DIMYBFQ3A&quot;&gt;Haoge Combo Boss Adapter&lt;/a&gt;. While it doesn&#39;t have the quick release clamp like the Manfrotto, I find that during shooting I don&#39;t take the camera off tripod enough to make me miss that feature.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Haoge Combo Boss Adapter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adapter itself is very well built, made from a machined aluminum alloy. The adapter simply bolts in place on the top of the ball head, takes about a minute if you take your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason I wanted to switch over to an Arca-Swiss mount was so I could also get a &lt;a target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fotga-Release-Bracket-Battery-Compat/dp/B01DKEWW8K?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=ox_sc_act_title_2&amp;smid=A1POCZTLJ8H9VM&quot;&gt;Fotga L Plate Bracket&lt;/a&gt; to mount my camera both horizontally and vertically on the tripod. With the normal mount on the bottom of the camera, vertical shots require you to tilt the ball head 90&amp;deg; to the side, which means you lose a good 6&quot; of height. Since I am 6&#39;6&quot; even when the camera is in the normal position I have to crouch a little bit, meaning vertical shots are just flat out awkward for me. With an L bracket I can simply mount the camera on the left side of the body, keeping the eyepiece at a comfortable level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fotga bracket is also very well made, designed specifically for the Canon 5DMkIII. The curved aluminum frame feels unobtrusive while shooting hand held and more importantly the design allows access to all the ports as well as the battery tray without having to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am being honest the thumbscrew on the base plate makes everything feel a bit more secure and tight when the camera is mounted versus the old Manfrotto quick mount. I am still cautious whenever the camera is on the tripod, but I definitely feel a bit more at ease with this setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very happy with both the Haoge adapter and the Fotga bracket, they fit together perfectly. A great addition to my setup, I am looking forward to being more comfortable shooting landscape panoramas and just having a bit more flexibility with my tripod now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Oregon Travelogue</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I flew out to Portland Oregon to attend the WebVisions design conference and while I was there I had some free time to explore. Scouring Google Maps and various online resources I put together a small list of places I wanted to see and things to shoot. On my list were Cannon Beach, Saddle Mountain, Pittock Mansion, and Multnomah Falls. I knew I couldn&#39;t hit them all with my limited time, so I figured I would play it by ear and wait to see what the weather was like when I arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While flying in the captain came over the intercom to say that out the right side would be Mt Adams and Mt Saint Helens, so I was able to grab a quick shot of them before touching down at Portland Airport. Having grown up in the midwest, mountains and large elevation changes are still amazing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/0K6A2899.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mt Adams and Mt Saint Helens&lt;span&gt;1/500th, f/5, ISO100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting out of the airport and checked into the hotel the forecast looked perfect, so I headed up to Cannon Beach along the coast to see Haystack Rock. Fans of &lt;i&gt;The Goonies&lt;/i&gt; will recognize this as the iconic rock formation just outside Astoria where Mikey holds up the key to learn the location of the entrance to the cave where One Eyed Willie&#39;s ship was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One amazing feature of Cannon Beach is the tide pools that host a wide variety of wildlife which you can explore at low-tide. I arrived an hour or so before sunset so I had time to soak in the scenery and setup my shot before golden hour began. While walking along the beach I found a huge boulder sticking out of the sand completely covered in mussels and barnacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A2935.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Barnacles and mussels&lt;span&gt;1/200th, f/8, ISO200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particularly bold seagull was picking mussels off the outcropping while hopping around avoiding the larger waves. I snapped a few photos of him just as he was taking off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A4009.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Seagull&lt;span&gt;1/6000th, f/4.5, ISO500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking off he headed over to a small set of rocks that were getting pummeled by the waves but he didn&#39;t seem to mind at all, jumping up and down as the water almost swept him away a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/0K6A3759.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Seagull&lt;span&gt;1/6000th, f/4.5, ISO500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Doran Morgenstern&#39;s work I tried my hand at a few long-exposure pans of the waves to see if I could get some dreamy abstract photos of the early evening sunlight on the ocean water. It&#39;s a shame I don&#39;t live on the coast because I would love to try more work in this style. You can see Doran&#39;s amazing work &lt;a target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.doranmorgenstern.com&quot;&gt;on his website here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Ocean waves&lt;span&gt;0.5s, f/22, ISO50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a number of photographers on the beach setting up for different angles for sunset however I was the only one brave enough to get wet. I rolled my jeans up over my knees and firmly planted my tripod about two inches down into the sand. If you don&#39;t firmly seat your tripod the undercurrent will strip sand out from underneath the feet which will ruin your exposure. With my 16-35mm I was able to get in close - at 235 feet tall Haystack Rock took up the right side of the frame with the two large rocks called The Needles setup on the left third. In the foreground was the barnacle covered rock from earlier getting swallowed by the incoming tide. I didn&#39;t notice this particular shot until I saw it on the computer - having the shutter open for 2 seconds the water cascaded over the large rock in the foreground creating some really white streaks over the top and front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A3261.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Haystack Rock&lt;span&gt;2s, f/22, ISO50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the light really started dropping off and I started losing feelings in my toes I decided to get back to dry land. Knowing I already had a number of shots I really liked from in the water I decided to take a few more from a bit farther back until the light was gone. This is one of the last shots of the night, as the light is dying the waves broke over a medium sized group of rocks sending water high into the air as the tide came in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A3334.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Haystack Rock&lt;span&gt;2.5s, f/18, ISO50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being rained out the second evening, the weather cleared up the next afternoon so after the conference I headed east to Multnomah Falls just outside Portland. The photos I had seen made it look like a remote location, however when I got there it was swarming with tourists. As fought for a parking space the skies opened up and dumped a massive amount of rain down almost out of nowhere. I stayed in the car for about 10 minutes until it slowed down to a drizzle, then got out my rain gear and headed out. Thankfully the rain drove a lot of tourists away so when I walked up to the base of the falls there were only a few intrepid (and soaking wet) people left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the base of a cliff, the Multnomah falls are split into two main sections, combined they reach over 600&#39; straight up, quite a wondrous sight. Shooting all the way open at 16mm I could have gone from the base to the top however the sky was an ugly gray, so I zoomed in a touch to just below the horizon. Adding a variable ND filter I was able to open the shutter up for about 1-2 seconds each time depending on if the sun was peeking through or not. This shot is from when the sun was completely covered, casting a soft light over the entire area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A3635.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Multnomah Falls&lt;span&gt;1.6s, f/22, ISO50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shot for a while with the 16-35mm and was happy with what I was seeing, so I decided to try the 70-200mm and get in close to the water. At this point the wind was picking up so just about every shot was blurred from the camera buffeting in the wind. This was the only one that made it, just as the sun broke through the clouds casting a spotlight down on the top of the second portion of the falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A3623.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Multnomah Falls&lt;span&gt;0.8s, f/25, ISO50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last day&#39;s forecast looked like I had a 50/50 chance of being rained out and since I had a limited amount of time left I decided I had to try, so I packed up and headed up to Saddle Mountain. The drive out was nice and clear, however when the road started getting higher in elevation the rain started in again. After reaching the base of the mountain it wasn&#39;t too bad so I decided to give it a try. I didn&#39;t get more than 1/4 mile in when it started getting too dangerous to try alone while carrying a bunch of camera gear. The trail was very narrow and slick so I figured instead of risking my safety I would come back some day when I could properly do the hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/0K6A3408.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Saddle Mountain&lt;span&gt;1/200th, f/4, ISO3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saddle Mountain was not too far Cannon Beach so I decided to head down to the coast and see if conditions improved at all, if they hadn&#39;t I read of a few places that served some wonderful clam chowder so win/win either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I had arrived it was a complete 180&amp;deg; from Saddle Mountain. On the coast it was in the upper 70s and not a cloud in the sky. People were everywhere so I took some candid photos of a woman&#39;s black lab as it sprinted in and out of the waves, having the time of its life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A3916.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Playing in the surf&lt;span&gt;1/1600th, f/2.8, ISO200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having gotten some amazing shots of Haystack Rock a few nights before, I wanted some closer shots of the waves breaking over The Needles. With the variable ND filter on my 70-200mm I was able to slow my shutter down to about 1/4th of a second, capturing a bit of motion without over exposing the shot. I love the colors of the ocean here, lots of turquoise and blues, much different from my first visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A3894.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Haystack Rock&lt;span&gt;1/4th, f/32, ISO50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evenings sunset was a bit less dramatic than before, however it was serene and calming, so I took some long exposures looking Southward from the other side of Haystack. I had attempted to shoot some panoramas but with the waves in different positions between frames it&#39;s proving to be extra difficult stitching them together, lots of work to be done. Here&#39;s one of the final shots from my last night in Oregon, I hope to bring the family next time and see even more of the coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/catalog/0K6A4219.jpg&quot;&gt;
