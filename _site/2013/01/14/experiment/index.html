<h3><span class="icon Blog"></span> Experiment</h3>
  <p>I hear a lot of less-experienced photographers bemoaning the fact that they don't have a particular lens, or their camera 'isn't good enough', and it always frustrates me. You don't need the latest 20+ Megapixel camera to produce great images. Keep practicing with the gear you have, and more importantly push yourself and try something you've never done before. For my Photo 365 project I decided to try to catch a droplet splashing out of water but I don't have a ring flash or enclosed soft-box - heck my tripod was in the trunk of my car with my wife at work.</p>
<p>Necessity is the mother of invention so I grabbed some things in the kitchen and setup a mini-studio. I used a glass of water, an eye dropper, a lamp as a secondary light, my flash &amp; sync cable, and ...a chopstick?</p>
<img src="/images/experiment.jpg" />
<p>I set the camera up on a plastic tupperware container as a makeshift tripod and switched over to manual focus mode since nothing would be moving. Looking through the camera I couldn't tell if I was in focus on the center of the water's surface, so I dipped the chopstick in dead center and focus locked on that.  I grabbed my cable release in one hand and the eye dropper in the other and tried to sync the drop to the shutter.  At first I tried the built-in timer but couldn't get the droplet to hit at the right time, so I resorted to dropping multiple drops not too far apart and releasing the shutter during.  It only took me a few shots to get the timing down. About 10 minutes of setup and a few minutes of shooting and I captured this one:</p>

<p>Its not going to appear in any magazines thats for sure, but then again it was about 15 minutes with no additional equipment. No high-speed camera, no special lighting, just what I had in my camera bag and kitchen. <i>f</i>/19, 1/200th, ISO 100. This was just an experiment, I like to tinker around. Next time I will probably distill the water first so its free of impurities, and I may try a larger container so I can get more of a horizontal shot. I only spent a few minutes tinkering around in the kitchen, but I already have a better understanding of macro-photography setups, and how I can improve next time.</p>
