<h3><span class="icon Photo"></span> </h3>
  <p>My favorite photo in August came from Cruise Nights in downtown Westmont, IL. <a href="http://cadillaccasanovas.com">The Cadillac Cassanovas</a> are a great three piece rockabilly band from the Chicagoland area who put on a great show who I was lucky enough back in May to shoot at the Arcada in St. Charles. So when I saw that they were playing not far from me, I knew I had to grab the camera and head over to see them. This particular shot serves as an example of sticking to it and not leaving until the show is over, your cards or full, or your batteries are dead. The event was in front of a really ugly brick building with a really distracting banner behind them and people walking all over, needless to say it wasn't the greatest venue to shoot at. Their first set was probably around 7, and in broad daylight. Really hard light, poor shooting conditions, and super hot so I wasn't really happy with too many shots. I got a few but overall nothing compared to the Arcada show. During the break between sets I walked around checking out the cool cars and cooling off a little bit, and almost decided to go home. Thankfully I didn't.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to meet the guys backstage at the Arcada show so I really try to do my best to get some great images for them, but I just wasn't feeling it that night. However, I decided to stick with it and see what I could get in the second set. As the sun started going down their stage lights started to take over as the primary light source. Using a faster shutter speed I started blackening out the background which was full of distractions. This particular photo is a portrait of the Cassanovas bass player Rick Uppling. Rick is a great musician and always fun to photograph since he's usually jumping around, standing on his huge upright bass, or just generally hamming it up for the audience. The stage lights were to his left creating a great backlight that highlighted the edges of his face, creating a wonderful edge silhouette. While shooting I was careful not to cut off the headstock of his bass, as well as try to get both hands in shot. Framing can be tricky when photographing musicians in concert, especially guitarists and bassists.</p>

<p>Their stage lighting setup was casting a bunch of different color all over the place, so the color version of this photo was really strange looking. I ran it through Silver Efex Pro to convert it to black &amp; white and thats when the photo really jumped. My only critique is that I caught the lead signer &amp; guitarist Carl's headstock poking into the left side of frame. Overall I love this portrait and am really thankful that I stuck with it that night. Be sure to check their <a href="http://cadillaccasanovas.com">website</a> to see when the Cassanovas will be rocking near you.</p>
