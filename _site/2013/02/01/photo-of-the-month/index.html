<h3><span class="icon Blog"></span> Photo Of The Month</h3>
  <p>One month into the Photo365 challenge and I feel it has been going very well so far. The goal when I started wasn't to produce portfolio-worthy images every day - it was mainly to keep practicing my craft while pushing myself to step outside my comfort zone and shoot things I normally wouldn't. Some days were harder than others, but overall it has been thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
<p>A few shots stand out more than others, but the one that caught the most attention was actually completely random.  On January 24th I had to walk from one client to another in the middle of a rather blustery Chicago snowstorm.  I had a vague idea of how to get from A to B, but didn't have a specific route in mind. I just started walking and snapping pictures as I went. A few turns in the general direction I found myself in front of a row of very interesting looking townhomes in the River North neighborhood. Thankfully nobody was parked in front so I took a quick photo and kept walking. </p> 
<img src="/images/pom_january.jpg" />
<p>The image was captured at f9.5 at 1/90, ISO 100. I intentionally kept my shutter speed down to catch the snow swirling in front of the lens. I was not sure of exactly how it would show up after processing, but I love how it turned out. I'm undecided if this one will make it to print or portfolio, but it looks beautiful as a desktop image on my Cinema Display. One month down, eleven to go!</p>

    <p><img class='left headshot' src='/images/headshot-footer.jpg' alt='Chris Peak, Chicago based Photographer' />I am a photographer and web-developer from Chicago, IL. Specializing in landscape and nature photography, I also love shooting portraits, band promos, and concert photography whenever I get the chance. I have been lucky enough to shoot in Chicago, New York, Tokyo, London, and more.
