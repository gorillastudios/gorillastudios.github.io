<h3><span class="icon Blog"></span> Photo 365 FAQ</h3>
  <p>I am 52 days into my Photo365 challenge and have already gotten a few people asking me almost the same questions about the project, so I thought I would explain a little bit more about why I am doing this exercise and what my guidelines are.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> - A number of reasons, some of which are: Staying sharp by taking at least one photo every day, keeping my camera on me at almost all times (I <i>hate</i> that feeling when I wish I had it), to push myself to try different styles I normally wouldn't shoot, and also it acts as a photo diary for the year.  Im looking forward to having all 365 in a gallery, I have kicked around ideas about what to do with the final set, but more on that later in the year.</p>
<p><strong>Do you really take and post one photo a day?</strong> - I try to take at the very least one photo per day, but also limit myself to no more than 36 if its not a photo walk or specific shoot. The main point of the limit is so I don't keep second guessing or trying the same shot over again. I want to see the bad shots as well as the good.  I try to post the photo on the same day, but if I have to wait until morning I am okay with that.</p>
<p><strong>How much time per day?</strong> - Like I said I usually limit myself to a handful of shots, the average seems to be about 5-10 per day. I also limit myself to three minutes of photoshop touchup for any given photo.  I have a timer set and when beeps, thats it. I try to get the best photo I can straight from the camera - however I have been playing around with some alternate edits I usually don't try like half-saturation and stylized filters.</p>
<p><strong>What have you learned so far?</strong> - I have noticed that I am looking around for photo opportunities a lot more than I used to. It was difficult getting into the habit of bringing my SLR everywhere, but my Black Rapid strap really helps with that - I just sling it over my shoulder and head out. I like to see the progress I have made, and I also like seeing the good shots contrasted with some of the bad. I can see days where I just wasn't feeling very creative, and then others where I wish I could have posted a lot more.</p>

<p>Here is the photo from today, February 22nd.  I simply walked a few blocks out of my way after work and took a handful of shots as I went. I was quite surprised at how this one came out. Allowing myself three minutes for editing I spent most of the time adjusting the highlights &amp; color temp, and staying true to the limit I didn't get a chance to straighten the composition.</p>
<p>Remember to keep shooting and have fun.</p>
