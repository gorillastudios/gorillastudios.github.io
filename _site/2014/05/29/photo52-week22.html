<p>Well, after a long hiatus I am finally back into the swing of things. Lately we have been getting some spectacular sunsets here in Chicago so I decided to head out and see what I could get on a very windy Thursday afternoon. I picked up a Divvy bike just around the corner from my office and headed down to the lake. To say it was windy is an understatement. It was close to 70 in the afternoon, but after a half hour I was uncomfortably cold. Not much really grabbed me as there was a pretty thick haze over the city, so I grabbed another Divvy and peddled my way around the Field Museum campus just to kill some time before sundown. A side note, I now consider a Divvy key fob to be an essential part of any Chicago-based photographers toolkit. Instead of lugging my gear all over the loop I was able to just pull a bike and head to where I want with very little effort.</p>
<p>After circling Solider Field and the Shedd Aquarium I braved the bitter wind and went back down to the lake by the Adler Planetarium, one of the best spots in the city to see the skyline. The haze started to part, but when the sun started dipping below the buildings it ducked down right behind 311 S. Wacker to create these beautiful sunbeams casting past the Sears Tower and right over the lake. I wanted to get in tight so I switched to my 55-200mm and shot that wide open at 55. I love the sun bursting out from the buildings, the silhouette of the skyline is much different than most shots with all of the lights on. I like how this one turned out.</p>
