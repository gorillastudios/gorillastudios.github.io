//  These are concerned with styling non-cosmetic design patterns, or 'objects'. Objects can range from something as simple as a .wrapper element, to layout systems, through to things like the OOCSS poster child â€“ the Media Object. This layer affects less of the DOM than the last layer, has a higher specificity, and is slightly more explicit in that we are now targeting sections of the DOM with classes.

.page-content {
  overflow: hidden;
  border: 4px solid white;
  &.slim {
    border: 0;
  }
  @include media($break__small) {
    border: 18px solid white;
  }
}


[class*="module__"] {
  border-top: 1px solid $hairline;
  padding: 20px;
  &.borderless {
    border: none;
  }
  @include media($break__small) {
    padding: 4em 20px;
  }
}


.module__single .content {
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 600px;
  width: 100%;
