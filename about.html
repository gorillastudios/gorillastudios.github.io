  <p>Founded in 2003, Gorilla-Studios is a showcase for my photography portfolio. I have been lucky enough to shoot in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, London and beyond. While primarily focusing on landscapes and architecture, I also specialize in live music, portraits, nature, and astrophotography as well.</p>
  <p>My work is an exploration of beauty and simplicity. We are surrounded by complexity and clutter every day and my photographs aim to give moments of relief. I take away as many distractions in frame as possible to give the viewer a sense of calm and serenity. Even though they are presented here online, they are best viewed in large format framed prints.</p>
  <p>I am available for commission work so please contact me to discuss your project. You will find a selection of my work in my portfolio with additional or specific content available upon request.</p>

    <h3>Where does the name Gorilla-Studios come from?</h3>
    <p>In 2003 when I started to get serious about my work I decided to create a website to showcase my portfolio. I didn't want to be just another photographer so 'Chris Peak Photography' just didn't stand out to me. Being young and not having found my personal style yet I had it in my head that I wanted to pursue architecture and urban subjects, so my first thought was Guerilla-Studios. I quickly realized two things - spelling it out to everyone would be a major pain, and it's really not representative of myself. I loved how it sounded though and one of my favorite books is Ishmael by Daniel Quinn. The book's main character is a very observant and wise gorilla, so that combined with my love of nature drove me to create Gorilla-Studios.</p>
    <p>It is also worth noting that all the animals featured in my work are in their natural environment. In 2003 I spent a few days wandering around Brookfield Zoo and during that time I realized the Silverback Gorilla just laid in the same spot for hours as if broken. It was then that I resolved to never profit from animals in captivity. While I applaud zoos like Brookfield's conservation efforts, I cannot morally justify making money from an animal suffering.</p>
    <h3>Where can I purchase your work?</h3>
    <p>Currently my work is not available to purchase online while I search for a vendor that matches my quality and price needs. Prints are available locally to the Chicagoland area in limited quantaties. Please reach out to me for more information.</p>
    <h3>What equipment do you use?</h3>
    <p>I currently shoot with a Canon EOS 5D MkIII, paired with a 16-35 f/4, 70-200 f/2.8, and a small number of other lenses. While I have shot Canon since purchasing a 6.3MP EOS 10D back in 2003, I firmly believe the best camera is the one you have on you. In my assortment of gear you will also find a Manfrotto tripod and ballhead, a Kata 3N1-33 Backpack, and a Black Rapid camera strap (a must have).</p>
