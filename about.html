    <h4>Where does the name Gorilla-Studios come from?</h4>
    <p>In 2003 when I started to get serious about my work I decided to create a website to showcase my portfolio. I didn't want to be just another photographer so 'Chris Peak Photography' just didn't stand out to me. Being young and not having found my personal style yet I had it in my head that I wanted to pursue architecture and urban subjects, so my first thought was Guerilla-Studios. I quickly realized two things - spelling it out to everyone would be a major pain, and it's really not representative of myself. I loved how it sounded though and one of my favorite books is <i>Ishmael</i> by Daniel Quinn. The book's main character is a very observant and wise gorilla, so that combined with my love of nature drove me to create Gorilla-Studios.</p>
    <p>It is also worth noting that all the animals featured in my work are in their natural environment. In 2003 I spent a few days wandering around Brookfield Zoo and during that time I realized the Silverback Gorilla just laid in the same spot for hours as if broken. It was then that I resolved to never profit from animals in captivity. While I applaud zoos like Brookfield's conservation efforts, I cannot morally justify making money from an animal suffering.</p>
    <h4>Where can I purchase your work?</h4>
    <p>Currently my work is not available to purchase online. I had previously used 500px as a vendor to handle my printing, framing, and shipping, however they shifted their business model with no warning and ceased operations. Prints are available locally to the Chicagoland area in limited quantaties. Please reach out to me for more information.</p>
    <h4>What equipment do you use?</h4>
    <p>I currently shoot with a Canon EOS 5D MkIII, paired with a 16-35 f/4, 70-200 f/2.8, and a small number of other lenses. While I have shot Canon since purchasing a 6.3MP EOS 10D back in 2003, I firmly believe the best camera is the one you have on you. In my assortment of gear you will also find a Manfrotto tripod and ballhead, a Kata 3N1-33 Backpack, and a Black Rapid camera strap (a must have).</p>
