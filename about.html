  <h3>About Gorilla-Studios</h3>
  <p>Gorilla-Studios was launched in 2003 as a place to showcase my photography portfolio as well as exercise my web design skills. In the past twelve years I have been lucky enough to shoot in Chicago, New York, Tokyo, and London. While primarily focusing on landscape and urban photography, I also specialize in live music, portraits, and nature photography. I am available for commission work so please contact me to discuss your project. You will find a selection of <a href="/portfolios/">my best work in my portfolios</a> with additional or specific content available upon request.</p>
  <p>Please enjoy.</p>
  <h3>About Chris</h3>
  <p>I first picked up a Nikor film SLR in high school and fell in love with photography sometime around 1995. After getting comfortable working with analog 35mm film, in 2003 I purchased a Canon EOS 10D and dove head first into the digital world. Over the past 20 years I have taken my camera with me around the globe trying to capture as much of it as I can. From the very first time I picked up a camera my goal has been to create incredibly bold and unique images. I do my best to stand out and strive to stay true to my own unique style.</p>
