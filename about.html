    <p>Founded in 2003, Gorilla-Studios is a showcase for my photography portfolio. I have been lucky enough to shoot in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, London and beyond. While primarily focusing on landscapes and architecture, I also specialize in live music, portraits, and nature photography as well. I am available for commission work so please contact me to discuss your project. You will find a selection of <a href="/#portfolios">my work in my portfolios</a> with additional or specific content available upon request.</p>
