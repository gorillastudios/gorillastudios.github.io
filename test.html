  <p>In just a few hours I'll be hopping a plane and headed to London for the <a href='http://futureofwebdesign.com/london-2013/'>Future of Web Design Conference</a>. I will be in England for a week, coming back next Thursday, so there won't be many updates on the site, but keep an eye on my <a href='http://twitter.com/gorilla_studios/'>Twitter</a> and <a href='http://gorilla-studios.tumblr.com'>Tumblr</a> feeds for quick updates and photos if I have time. I plan on taking most of of my free time and shooting as much as I can, sleep be damned. See you next week!</p>

        <p>Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.</p>

  <p>"Swim away from me, do ye?" murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water. There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,â€”"Up helm! Keep her off round the world!"</p>
