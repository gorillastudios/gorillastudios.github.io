  <h3>Whats In The Bag?</h3>
  <p>I get a lot of questions about what camera and lenses I shoot with and what gear I like to carry, so I am going to write a few posts covering what's in my bag and what I lug around on a typical shoot.  Here's my usual gear bag for general shoots:</p><img alt='Lowepro Camera Bag' src='/images/bag.jpg' /><p>And my primary DSLR....</p><img alt='Canon EOS 10D DSLR' src='/images/10D.jpg' /><p>I shoot everything with my trusty EOS 10D.  Its pretty antiquated these days, but I still get great results.  It has a 6.1MP CMOS which still holds it's own in most situations but is severely lacking in low-light situations. It has an ISO range from 100 to 1600, however I rarely get shots above ISO 800 that I really like. All the photos in the gallery were shot with the 10D paired with various lenses (which I will go over individually later).  Originally purchased in 2003, the camera is still solid as a rock after taking (and this is an estimate) somewhere in the neighborhood of at least 50,000 photos.  The primary shutter button is just starting to flake out, it takes a firm press and there is a bit of a delay but thankfully I have it paired to a dual-battery grip with vertical controls.</p><p>Once my checkbook has recovered from the wedding I am planning on investing in a 5D MkII.  Remember the phrase <em>'Buy once, buy right'</em>.  Don't buy something thats good enough for now that you may outgrow later just because you can afford it. Save up and invest in good equipment - it will last and you'll be much happier.  I made the mistake as a young photographer by purchasing a number of really slow lenses not knowing exactly what I should have gotten.  I saw the Canon 70-200mm f2.8 but didn't understand why that was so much more than an off brand f4 telephoto.  There is a huge difference in quality and without experience I couldn't see that.  Remember, you don't need a bunch of fancy lenses and the latest greatest equipment to be a great photographer.  Invest in a solid DSLR, and one or two fast lenses, and shoot, shoot, SHOOT.  Practice and experience make the photographer, not the gear.</p><p>I'll be writing some more posts about the rest of the gear in my bag, so check back later or subscribe to my RSS Feed.  Feel free to contact me with any gear questions, and have fun shooting!<br />
