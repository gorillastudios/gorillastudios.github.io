  <h3>Photo Of The Month</h3>
  <img src="/images/pod/118_full.jpg" alt="Flooding at Island Park in Geneva, IL"/>
<p>April's photo of the month was taken in the flood waters at Island Park in Geneva, IL. After the storms rolled through in the middle of the month most of the major rivers and creeks flooded severely. Since travel was hazardous I waited for the initial surge to subside before exploring - even a week later a lot of areas were still underwater. Island Park is located on the Fox River in downtown Geneva, and most of the inside of the park was still under a foot or two of water as I sloshed my way through. Very carefully I made my way into the park and setup my tripod almost dead center looking north back towards downtown which you can see in the top left. Since it was close to noon with a bright blue sky the park was very well lit. I stacked three ND filters and closed the aperture down to f/22. That combination allowed me to open the shutter for around 4 seconds, smoothing out the water. I found that unless I used my hands as a hood the first ND filter would reflect the branding from the front of the lens back into the exposure.</p> 
<p>Water and camera gear don't mix, so needless to say when you are shooting in or around water be extremely careful. I didn't have any issues with gear, the heart-attack of the day came from nature itself. It appeared some large fish were trapped inside of the park as the waters had receded enough to cut off access to the river, but was still deep enough for them to swim and every so often flopping out of the water. While taking photos I was in the middle of one shot when a large fish brushed my leg, jumped up out of the water, and then swam off very quickly. To be honest I let out a choice word or two and tried to get pulse back down to double digits. Be careful out there!</p>
